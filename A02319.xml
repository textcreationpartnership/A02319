         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The mi≈øtery then of this ≈øecret is, that he wold not an≈øwer, in the fir≈øt two Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals when they accu≈øed him of wickedne≈ø≈øe and ≈øcandale: but vpon the cro≈ø≈øe where he was an aduocate, he began pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently to ≈øpeake and plead for vs, ≈øaying. <hi>Pater igno≈øce illis,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forgiue them, in ≈øo much that for to excu≈øe my offences, he omitteth to an≈øwere for him≈øelfe.

Doe≈øt thou make interce≈øsion for my fault, &amp; doe≈øt thou not remember thy owne life? Who but thou did euer excu≈øe tho≈øe which accu≈øed him, and defend them which condemne
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3666:7"/>him? <hi>An≈øelmus</hi> in his meditations ≈øayth, <hi>O quam ignitum e≈øt eloquium tuum,</hi> My ≈øweet Ie≈øus ≈øeeing that on the cro≈ø≈øe thou didde≈øt excu≈øe mee which was in the fault, and returned≈øt no an≈øwere for thy ≈øelf being without fault, the which thou did≈øt being enflamed with loue, and very full of griefe: Now that thou doe≈øt intreat, now that thou doe≈øt craue, why doe≈øt thou not entreat thy good father that hee would mitigate thy griefes, as well as forgiue ≈øinners? Ha≈øt thou no pittie of thy owne holy members which are loo≈øed one from another, and ha≈øt thou it towards thy enemies which are not as yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted vnto thee? Seeing thou art a≈øwell bound to defend the innocent, as make interce≈øsion for the wicked, why ha≈øt thou no pittie vpon thy owne innocent fle≈øh, a≈øwell as of my enormious crimes? <hi>Vbertinus</hi> ≈øayth, <hi>O quam vehementer e≈øt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum eloquium tuum,</hi> My good Lord, ≈øeeing thou doe≈øt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øe him who is culpable, entreate≈øt without entreaty, forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue≈øt without ≈øatisfaction, heape≈øt vp for tho≈øe which will not repay thee, and al≈øo die≈øt for tho≈øe which haue put thee to death: Seeing the law of <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> commandeth that the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor ≈øhould pay a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, foot for foot, eie for eie, and life for life, why doe≈øt thou O mighty redeemer giue thy hands vnto tho≈øe which bind the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, thy feet vnto tho≈øe which pierce them with nailes, thy eies vnto tho≈øe which make thee blind, and thy life vnto tho≈øe which take thy life from thee? If thou wilt not reuenge thy iniuries, why doe≈øt thou not let iu≈øtice doe iu≈øtice vpon thy enemies? S. <hi>Barnard</hi> ≈øayth in a ≈øermon, from the time that our Sauiour was taken in the garden, vntill hee was crucified on the cro≈ø≈øe, the works which he did were many, but the words which he ≈øpake were very few; whereby hee gaue vs to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtand, that in time of great vexations and per≈øecutions, it is fitter for vs to helpe our ≈øelues with patience than with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence. In this fir≈øt praier which the ≈øonne made vnto the father, it is to be noted who the father is, what that is that he asketh, of whom he asketh, when he asketh, from whence he asketh, how hee asketh, and for whome hee asketh; for by ≈øo
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3666:8"/>much the more one bu≈øine≈ø≈øe is greater than another, by how much the inconueniences are greater which it draweth after it. He who asketh is the ≈øonne, he of whom he asketh is the father, that which he asketh is pardon, the place fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> whence hee asketh is the cro≈ø≈øe, the time is when hee dieth, tho≈øe for whom are his enemies, the maner how is with many teares; in ≈øo much that a praier offered vvith all the≈øe circum≈øtances, ought of great rea≈øon to be heard. This praier of <hi>Pater igno≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce illis,</hi> Father pardon them, is a very high praier, ≈øeeing that he vvhich made it vvas the ≈øonne of God, vvho ≈øaith, <hi>Si quid petieritis patrem in nomine meo dabit vobis,</hi> And if this bee ≈øo, how is it po≈øsible, that the father ≈øhould not graunt all that which the ≈øonne reque≈øteth, ≈øeeing hee promi≈øeth to giue all things that ≈øhall be demanded in his name? If this be a great praier by rea≈øon of him which maketh it, it is al≈øo a very great &amp; high praier by rea≈øon of him vnto whom it is made, which is, <hi>Pater mi≈øericordiaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> &amp; deus totus con≈øolationis,</hi> The father of mercies and the God of all comfort: the vvhich eternall father created vs vvith his power, guideth and gouerneth vs vvith his vvi≈øedome, ≈øu≈øtaineth and vpholdeth vs with his e≈ø≈øence, and forgiueth vs with his elemency, how is it po≈øsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that a ≈øonne vvhich hath ≈øuch a father, or a father vvhich hath ≈øuch a ≈øonne ≈øhould not grant his demand? This praier of <hi>Pater igno≈øce illis,</hi> was al≈øo very great becau≈øe of the place vvhere it was made, which was in the mount of Caluarie, and on the altar of the cro≈ø≈øe, vvhere the vvrath of the eternall father was appea≈øed, his ble≈ø≈øed ≈øonne put to death, the vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked deuil ouercome, the old ≈øinne forgiuen, and all the world there redeemed. S. <hi>Ambro≈øe</hi> vpon S. <hi>Luke</hi> ≈øayth, how much the Iewes di≈øhonoured the holy temple, ≈øo much Chri≈øt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored the Mount of Caluary; for they made a den of theeues of the hou≈øe of praier, and the ≈øonne of God made a hou≈øe of praier, of a den of theeues.

The ≈øonne of God praying on the infamous and ≈øtinking place of the Mount of Caluary, giueth all men licen≈øe to pray vnto God, where they will, and how they will, and for whome ≈øo euer they will, becau≈øe the perfection of praier, doth not con≈øi≈øt of the place where wee pray, but of the ≈ømall or great deuotion with the which wee pray: According vnto that which the Samaritane woman ≈øaid vnto Chri≈øt. That many Iews would not pray but within the temple; and it may bee to take away this error wee doe read that the ≈øon of God did not pray there, but preach only; which our ble≈ø≈øed Sauiour did becau≈øe no man ≈øhould excu≈øe him≈øelfe from praier &amp; deuotion, ≈øaying that the temple was ≈øhut vp. <hi>Vbertinus</hi> ≈øaith, that the ≈øonne of God is not a≈øhamed to pray, <hi>Pater igno≈øce illis,</hi> on the dunghill of the Mount of Caluary; and art thou a≈øhamed to pray alone in thy hou≈øe? O what a high charge and office the office of meditation and praieris, con≈øidering that Chri≈øt his being naked on the cro≈ø≈øe with his handes bound and tied, his feet peirced with nailes, his head crowned with thornes, his mouth ≈øea≈øoned with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger, did not hinder him to pray, <hi>Pater igno≈øce illis,</hi> Father forgiue them: and ≈øeeing hee pardoned and forgaue with his heart, and praied with his tongue.</p>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3666:12"/>riuer Cobar in the two and twentith chapter of his prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øie. And it is as if he would ≈øay, <hi>Ezechiell</hi> I haue beene many a day angrie with Ieru≈øalem, and I ≈øeeke out a holy and a vertuous man, which ≈øhould put him≈øelfe like a hedge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt mee and the people of I≈øraell, becau≈øe their offences might not come vnto mee, nor my puni≈øhment reach vnto them. Wee may inferre of the complaint which our Lord maketh in this place, what great ≈øcar≈øitie there was in the ≈øy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, of good men, ≈øeeing he found not one among them all which was worthie to appea≈øe the wrath of the Lord, and to helpe and ≈øuccour the people. The merites of good men are of great force and power before God, for to pardon the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill in their faith, which is ea≈øily ≈øeene in all the cities of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which he did pardon for ten good mens ≈øake, and all the twelue tribes of I≈ørael which he pardoned for one alone: but ala≈ø≈øe neither in the ≈øynagogue was there found that one, neither in Sodome tho≈øe ten. To ≈øay the truth it was no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile that hee was not to be found in all the ≈øynagogue, with tho≈øe conditions, which God required in him: for he ought to haue ben a man in di≈øcretion and not a child, and the Lord him≈øelfe was to make choice of him and no other, and he was to be an Hebrew and not a Gentile, &amp; he was to put him≈øelfe a mediator betwixt God and the people, and it was required that he ≈øhould be partiall on neither ≈øide. And our Lord was not content onely with this, but that mediator ought al≈øo to haue de≈øert and merit in him, to appea≈øe Gods indignation, and not ≈øinne to ≈øtirre him to wrath. S. <hi>Gregory</hi> vpon <hi>Ezechiell</hi> ≈øayth, I doubt whether a man endued with the≈øe conditions, and ≈øhining with the≈øe vertues, might bee found among≈øt the Angelicall Hierarchies, how much le≈ø≈øe among humane cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures, becau≈øe ≈øuch a one ≈øhould bee more than man, yea he ≈øhould be equall with God. <hi>Abraham, I≈øaac, Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> and all the letanie of the old and new te≈øtament, were not equall with God, nor any thing more then men, ≈øeeing they were borne in ≈øinne, and attained vnto no diuine ≈øecret with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it were reuealed vnto them. The ≈øonne of God only was
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3666:12"/>equall vnto God, and the diuine vvord only vvas more than man, becau≈øe in him, and in no other, tho≈øe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ditions of a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man were found which God ≈øought for, and the vertues which ≈øhould paci≈øie God his wrath and anger. The fir≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which God required, was, that this mediator ≈øhould be a man in wi≈ødome, and not a child, which may better bee verified in Chri≈øt than in any other, ≈øeeing that from the fir≈øt in≈øtant that he tooke humane fle≈øh vpon him he ≈øaw the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine e≈ø≈øence, and knew as much as hee dooth now in glorie, vvhich is not ≈øo in other men, ≈øeeing they are long a bringing vp, and vvaxe old very timely. The ≈øonne of God vvas al≈øo an Hebrue of the tribe of Iuda a vvhich vvas the mo≈øt honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ≈øtocke of all the tribes, and hee vvas of Nazareth vvhich vvas a holy land: and he vvas al≈øo the mo≈øt honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all his kindred. Thirdly, the ≈øonne of God vvas be≈øt beloued of his father becau≈øe of him, and of no other, he ≈øaid in his bapti≈øme. <hi>Hic est filius meus dilectus,</hi> as if hee vvould ≈øay, This is only my lawful child, in him only am I vvel plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed, this only is my heire, him onely I doe tender and loue, in him I delight, and take great contentment. Fourthly, the ≈øon of God vvas a very thicke mud vvall, a clo≈øe hedge, vvhich put him≈øelfe betwixt God and the people, vvhen he ≈øuffered him≈øelfe to bee crucified vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, vpon the vvhich as ≈øtrong battelments they di≈øcharged all the ≈øinnes vvhich vvere in the vvorld, and all the wrath vvhich God had. O glorious hedge, O happie vvall, O ≈øtrong vvounds, ≈øuch vva≈øt thou O redeemer of my ≈øoule, ≈øeeing thou didde≈øt permit, and con≈øent to put thy ≈øelfe a mediator betwixt God &amp; man, to the end they ≈øhould vnlode and put vpon thee all the ≈øins of the vvorld, and all the vengeance vvhich God vvas to take for them. S. <hi>Gregory</hi> vpon <hi>Ezechiell</hi> ≈øayth, The ≈øonne of God only vvas the man he ≈øought for, this vvas the vvall he required, this vvas the mediator he asked for, this is the paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier of the old quarrell, and of Gods vvrath, this is the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of new grace, and this is the ouerthrower of the old ≈øinne. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> vpon this place ≈øayth. The man vvhich God ≈øought
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3666:13"/>by <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> who el≈øe was hee, but the ≈øon of the liuing God, and our redeemer? Who like vnto an vnexpugnable wall, did put him≈øelfe boldly betwixt God and vs, ≈øaying, <hi>Pater ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no≈øce illis,</hi> Father forgiue them. By which words, he did not like, that our ≈øinnes ≈øhould come into the ≈øight of God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øuffered he Gods wrath and vengeance to de≈øcend vpon vs. <hi>Origen</hi> vpon S. <hi>Marke</hi> ≈øayth, That whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the two chiefe cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of the ≈øynagogue, <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> perceiued that the Lord began to poure his wrath and anger vpon the people, they went immediatly vnto the tabernacle, the one to pray, and the other to doe ≈øacrifice to be a mean betwixt God and them; becau≈øe that otherwi≈øe, God would haue poured out his anger vpon them, &amp; the Synagogue haue receiued great hurt and detriment. That which happened vnto tho≈øe two holy men in the de≈øart happened vnto Chri≈øt on the mount of Caluarie, who ≈øeeing the elements to be troubled, and the dead to ri≈øe againe, to reuenge his death and puni≈øh that nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he made him≈øelfe a mediator and a ≈øtikeler betwixt God and them, and praied, <hi>Paterigno≈øce illis,</hi> as if hee would ≈øay, Pardon them my father, pardon them; for if thou wilt not pardon them, it will bee a greater griefe vnto me to ≈øee them lo≈øt, then my pa≈øsion which cau≈øeth mee to die. What would become of the Iewes then, if Chri≈øt had not ≈øaid vnto his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, father forgiue them, and what ≈øhould betide vs now if he ≈øhould not ≈øay. <hi>Pater parce illis,</hi> Spare them father. S. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> ≈øaith in a ≈øermon, That this word of <hi>Igno≈øce illis,</hi> Forgiue them, is of ≈øuch a deepe con≈øideration, that it ≈øhould neuer be out of a ≈øinners mouth, nor blotted out of his memory: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe that the ≈øonne of God did ≈øhew his mercy more vnto vs in two things the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> in al the re≈øt: that is, in the pardon which he got vs of his father, and in the bloud which he ≈øhed for vs on the cro≈ø≈øe. <hi>An≈øelmus</hi> rea≈øoning with Chri≈øt ≈øayth, What doe≈øt thou crie for, what doe≈øt thou aske, what doe≈øt thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat for, what wilt thou, what ≈øeeke≈øt thou, what ≈øaie≈øt thou to thy father O good Ie≈øus, what ≈øaie≈øt thou? I intreat O my father, that thou woulde≈øt forgiue them, becau≈øe they know
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3666:13"/>not what they do, and that thou woulde≈øt load my fle≈øh with thy anger; and I intreat that there remaine nothing vntecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled vnto thee, becau≈øe that my redemption would ≈øeem vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect and in≈øufficient, if there ≈øhould remaine in any a fault to bee redeemed, and in thy ≈øelfe any anger to puni≈øh vs. O what an enflamed charity, what a wonderfull example, what incredible patience, what entire loue thou didde≈øt ≈øhew vs O ≈øweet Ie≈øus in this ≈øpeech of, Father forgiue them, the which thou didde≈øt vtter not for an ea≈øe to thy griefe, but in fauour of thy per≈øecutors! O what infinite goodne≈ø≈øe, what vn≈øpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able clemencie, what ≈øtrange charitie doth ≈øhine this day in thee O my Ie≈øus and ≈øauiour, ≈øeeing thou doe≈øt loo≈øe tho≈øe which bind thee, pleade≈øt for tho≈øe which diffame thee, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate≈øt for tho≈øe which accu≈øe thee, excu≈øe≈øt tho≈øe which blame thee, and pardone≈øt al≈øo tho≈øe which will kill thee! What meaneth this O good Ie≈øus, what meaneth this? doe≈øt thou pray for them at the very in≈øtant which they bla≈øpheme thee, mocke thee, and laugh thee to ≈øcorne? They haue pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thee with a ≈øpeare, and yet doe≈øt thou giue them an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance and a relea≈øe of the blow? What mortall man can prai≈øe him≈øelfe or bo≈øt to haue done that which thou ha≈øt done, that is to craue pardon for murderers before they haue confe≈ø≈øed their fault, and ≈øeeke to relea≈øe them before they haue repented? They will not returne into the citie before thou ha≈øt yeelded vp the gho≈øt, and wilt not thou die before thou ha≈øt fir≈øt pardoned them? Who euer ≈øaw or heard any thing like vnto this; to wit, that pardon ≈øhould proceed fir≈øt out of his ble≈ø≈øed bowels, before the blood ≈øhould end to i≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øue out of his tender vaines? Doe≈øt thou not remember to aske a ≈øepulchre for thy body, and doe≈øt thou remember to aske forgiuene≈ø≈øe and mercie for tho≈øe which crucified thee? O ≈øweet Ie≈øus, O my ≈øoules glorie, who but thou could haue the breath going out of his body, and <hi>Igno≈øce illis</hi> Pardon them in his mouth? To defend thy ≈øelfe coulde≈øt not thou open thy mouth, and to excu≈øe thy enemies could≈øt not thou keepe it ≈øhut? S. <hi>Chri≈øo≈øtome</hi> ≈øayth, The ≈øonne of God onely
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3666:14"/>was he, who on the altar of the cro≈ø≈øe, in≈øpeaking the≈øe words, Father forgiue them, coupled, ioined, and handfa≈øted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, pittie and cruelty, the offence and mercie, anger and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, hatred and loue, killing and pardoning. With as great rea≈øon (≈øayth <hi>Hilarius</hi>) we can now ≈øay, <hi>Vbi ≈øunt irae tuae anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quae,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ≈øaid, <hi>Vbi ≈øunt mi≈øericordiae tuae anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quae,</hi> ≈øeeing we bee certaine that from the houre that the ≈øon of God died vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the cro≈ø≈øe, we may cal him, <hi>Pater mi≈øericor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>,</hi> as the Synagogue called him, <hi>Deus vltionu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>,</hi> The God of reuenge. No man ought to di≈øtru≈øt Chri≈øts goodne≈ø≈øe and mercie, although he haue ben neuer ≈øo great a ≈øinner, ≈øo as he liue and die a Chri≈øtian: for ≈øeeing he pardoned tho≈øe which would not bee pardoned, hee will much rather pardon tho≈øe which aske for pardon. S. <hi>Barnard</hi> as if hee were in a maze ≈øayth thus vnto Chri≈øt; O good ≈øauiour, O my ≈øoules delight, if thou wilt pardon thy death, why doe≈øt thou pardon it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou bee dead? they tooke thy life from thee, to the end that thou ≈øhoulde≈øt forget ≈øuch a greeuous iniury done vnto thee, and make no reckoning to be reuenged. It is a tollerable thing to forgiue the iniury done vnto thy ≈øelf; but why doe≈øt thou forgiue the iniury done vnto thy ≈øorrowfull mother and thy ble≈ø≈øed father, not calling the parties offended vnto it? Thy mouth is now ready to receiue vineger, thy per≈øon to be mocked, thy ≈øide to bee pierced, thy bodie to bee buried, and yet doe≈øt thou make interce≈øsion for that wicked people? Doe≈øt thou entreat for tho≈øe which crucifie thee, and doe≈øt thou not remember tho≈øe which weepe by thee? Now that thou ha≈øt pitie on the offences of the ≈øynagogue, why ha≈øt thou not al≈øo compa≈øsion of the tears of thy ble≈ø≈øed mother? S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> vpon the pa≈øsion of our Lord ≈øayth: All things end with thee, and all for≈øake thee O ≈øweer Ie≈øus vpon the altar of the cro≈ø≈øe, ≈øauing only thy patience, with the which thou did de≈øt ≈øuffer thy torments, and thy charitie with the which thou didde≈øt forgiue thy enemies, ≈øeeing thou doe≈øt pray for tho≈øe which crucifie thee, entreat for tho≈øe which bla≈øpheme thee, hold thy peace again≈øt tho≈øe which ≈øpit on thee, excu≈øe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3666:14"/>tho≈øe which accu≈øe thee, and pardon tho≈øe which pardon not thee. O my redeemer, what a pitifull heart ha≈øt thou, that con≈øidering how the Iewes them≈øelues gaue thee licence to take reuengement on them: ≈øaying, <hi>Sanguis eius ≈øuper nos,</hi> His bloud vpon vs, yet thou didde≈øt not only not v≈øe this libertie giuen thee, but for≈øooke≈øt it, &amp; there pardoned thy iniury. O how contrary the≈øe two ≈øpeeches are, <hi>Sanguis eius ≈øit ≈øuper nos,</hi> Let his bloud fall vpon vs, and <hi>Igno≈øce illis,</hi> Pardon them: ≈øeeing that by the fir≈øt the Iewes craue puni≈øhment of God, and in the la≈øt Chri≈øt asketh pardon of his father for them: in ≈øo much that the bloud of Chri≈øt which they asked to bee again≈øt them, the ≈øon of God asketh that it may be for them! What ha≈øt thou to do O good ≈øauiour, what ha≈øt thou to do with the Iews (≈øayth <hi>Vbertinus</hi>) and hangmen and torturers? They goe about to condemne thee, and thou to ≈øaue them; they to accu≈øe thee, and thou to excu≈øe them; they to carry thee to <hi>Pilate</hi> to bee condemned, and thou to thy father that they may be pardoned; they to ≈øay, <hi>crucifige, crucifige,</hi> crucifie him, crucifie him, and thou to ≈øay, <hi>Igno≈øce, igno≈øce,</hi> Pardon them, Pardon them. At what time the ≈øon of God hanging vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, praied on one ≈øide vnto his father, and on the other ≈øide the Hebrews praied <hi>Pilate;</hi> there was a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict betwixt Gods iu≈øtice and mercie: for iu≈øtice willed the praier of <hi>Sanguis eius,</hi> Let his bloud fall vpon vs, to be heard, and contrary mercy forbad it, and would haue <hi>Pater igno≈øce illis,</hi> but in the end mercie had the vpper hand, and reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had no part therein. Who≈øe heart ≈øaith <hi>Bonauenture</hi> would not bleed, and who would not loue thee O good Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus, to ≈øee thee ≈øay to thy father, my father forgiue them, and not my father examine them, and to ≈øee that thou doe≈øt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> without asking, yeelde≈øt vnto them without entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and pardone≈øt them without amendment?

                     </gap>,</hi> ≈øayth the Apo≈øtle in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øtle to the Hebrewes, chap. 5. as if hee would ≈øay: When the ≈øonne of God was crucified: vpon the tree of the cro≈ø≈øe, hee made many reque≈øts vnto his father, &amp; with many ≈øupplications entreated him, praying vnto him with a loud voice, and pouring down many tears before him. This praier was well heard of the eternall father, and very acceptable vnto his diuine clemencie, partly becau≈øe hee who praied was a per≈øon worthy of great reuerence, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becau≈øe the praier which he made was founded vpon great pitie and mercie. It appeareth well that he which praied was of an excellent and perfect condition, and hee very mighty vnto whom he praied, and that which hee praied of great merit, and the manner which hee ob≈øerued in praier a perfect platforme of praier, ≈øeeing that the Apo≈øtle in this place laieth down ≈øuch high conditions of this praier which Chri≈øt made vpon the cro≈ø≈øe. Whereof although much be ≈øpoken, yet there remaineth much more not ≈øpoken of. Fir≈øt then he ≈øaith that Chri≈øt praied once on the cro≈ø≈øe, becau≈øe he ≈øaith, <hi>Cum clamore,</hi> with a crie; and with a high and loud voice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he ≈øaith, <hi>valido,</hi> ≈øtrong; and that with tears <hi>Cum lachri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis;</hi> and that hee praied and offered his praier at the ≈øame time vnto his father; and that the quality of the praier was
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3666:15"/>to entreat and be≈øeech, <hi>preces &amp; ≈øupplicationes;</hi> and that his praier was heard of his father at that very in≈øtant when hee made it, becau≈øe hee ≈øayth, <hi>&amp; exanditus e≈øt pro ≈øua reuerentia.</hi> The condition and qualitie of the praier which the ≈øonne of God made vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, which the Apo≈øtle toucheth here, is very great and worthy to bee marked and ob≈øerued with great heed, and followed with great diligence: for if we faile in any one of the≈øe conditions, we are ≈øaid rather to crie out then to pray. <hi>Theophilus</hi> vpon the Apo≈øtle ≈øayth, That when the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith that the ≈øonne of God praied with a loud voice vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, hee meaneth that hee offered and directed his praier with all his heart, and with all his will vnto God only, and vnto no other. For to ≈øay the truth, hee is ≈øaid to pray aloud, who≈øe mind is not di≈øtracted and drawne into many thoughts. When the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith that Chri≈øt praied aloud on the cro≈ø≈øe and with a ≈øtrong voice, he letteth vs vnder≈øtand with what a feruent de≈øire and great deuotion, he praied: for there is nothing reque≈øted aloud and by crying out, which is not either through abundance of loue, or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much griefe. Both together forced Chri≈øt to crie out vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, that is, the great loue he bare vnto his friends, and the ouermuch paine he ≈øuffered in his members. When the Apo≈øtle ≈øayth, That the ≈øonne of God offered vp praiers and ≈øupplications vpon the altar of the cro≈ø≈øe, hee declareth, as <hi>Theophilactus</hi> ≈øayth, That the praier <hi>igno≈øce illis</hi> was exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto the good and vnto the bad: in ≈øo much that for his enemies he offered praiers for the pardon of their ≈øinnes, and for his friends hee offered vp oblations for to confirme them in his grace. As the ≈øonne of God was Lord ouer all men and died for all men, ≈øo vpon the cro≈ø≈øe he praied for all men. For if the wicked had need of him to help them to ri≈øe, the good al≈øo had need of his helpe to keep them from falling. <hi>An≈øel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> in his meditations ≈øayth, That when the Apo≈øtle ≈øayth, that the ≈øonne of God was not content to pray only with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, but al≈øo offered vp that praier vnto his owne father, it is to let vs vnder≈øtand, that for the ≈øauing of all the world hee
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3666:16"/>offered vp his paines and ≈øorrowes for a recompence, his life for a ≈øatisfaction, his per≈øon for a reward, his bloud for a price, and his ≈øoule for a ≈øacrifice. It is al≈øo to bee weighed, that the ≈øonne of God made not this holy praier of <hi>Pater igno≈øce illis,</hi> Father forgiue them, ≈øitting but vpright, not being at libertie but bound, not in a low voice but aloud, not laughing but weeping, &amp; that which is mo≈øt to be maruelled at; the words that he praied with, were very few, but the tears he bathed them with, were very many. O good Ie≈øus, O my ≈øouls plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure, who could be worthy to ≈øtand at the foot of thy cro≈ø≈øe, to ≈øee how thy bloud ran from the thornes, and thy tears flow from thy eies, in ≈øo much that at the ≈øame hour and moment, thou didde≈øt water the earth with tears, and pierce the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens with ≈øighes! O what a ≈øacred word was that, O what a holy praier was <hi>Pater igno≈øce illis,</hi> Father forgiue them, ≈øeeing that it was made by the ≈øonne of God vpon the altar of the cro≈ø≈øe accompanied with ≈øighes, wa≈øhed with the bloud of Chri≈øt, and offered vp with the tears of the redeemer! Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ≈øonne of God reque≈øted the greate≈øt matter of his father and of the greate≈øt weight that euer was demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him, that is to wit, Pardon of his precious death, yet the tears which hee ≈øhed were ≈øo many, and the loue ≈øo great with the which he asked it, that if he had asked a greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of him, his father would neuer haue denied it him. S. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øill</hi> ≈øayth, O what great hurt ≈øinnes bring vnto vs, con≈øidering that for to lighten vs of them, and obtaine pardon for them, it was needfull for Chri≈øt to pray vnto his father for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, and offer oblation, and crie out, and ≈øuffer his bloud to bee ≈øhed, and tears to poure downe from his eies, ≈øo that thou O good Ie≈øus didde≈øt buy my great offences by the weight of thy bloud &amp; tears. Our Lord when he praied for his enemies vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, taught vs what forme and fa≈øhion wee ought to keepe when wee pray, that is, to ≈øhed bloud from our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and fall tears fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> our eies. The ≈øon of God wept when he praied for his enemies, and art not thou a≈øhamed to laugh and talke, when thou praie≈øt for the remi≈øsion of thy ≈øinnes? Yea

O great goodnest O infinit charity? The Sonne of God is in the garden alone, hee is pro≈øtrate on the ground giuing vp his gho≈øt, and yet ready for a new combat, his blood i≈ø≈øueth from all the pores of his body, he praieth thri≈øe for him≈øelfe, and thou wilt not heare him, and when he praieth for his enemies doe≈øt thou heare him at the fir≈øt word?

What would become of vs (≈øaith S. <hi>Ierome</hi>) if Chri≈øt ≈øhould not in his glory aboue, repeat that word vnto his father, <hi>Pater igno≈øce illis,</hi> Father forgiue them?

It is deeply here to be wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Chri≈øt did not ≈øay, Lord forgiue them, but, Father forgiue them; becau≈øe this word <hi>Lord</hi> is a fearefull word, but this word <hi>Father</hi> is a word of ioy: and therefore when one man calleth another Father, it ≈øeemeth that hee doth bind him to an≈øwere him friendly, and not to deny him any thing that he demandeth. Wee ≈øhall find often in holy ≈øcripture, that when God was angry with the Hebrewes, hee ≈øaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, <hi>Ego Dominus qui loquor vobis,</hi> I am the Lord which ≈øpeake vnto you: but when he would as it were flatter them and make much of them, he alwaies ≈øaid vnto them, <hi>Ego ero illis in patrem,</hi> I will be a father vnto them: that is, that hee would deale with them like a pitifull father, and not like a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Lord. In ≈øo much that this word <hi>Pater</hi> Father, bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth loue, and this word <hi>Lord</hi> bringeth feare. Alwaies when the ≈øonne of God made any great praier or asked any great fauour at his fathers hands, hee began his petition with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, O iu≈øt father, O holy father, making reckoning that by calling him father, nothing ≈øhould be denied him which was his ≈øonne. If Ie≈øus Chri≈øt ≈øhould haue begun his praier with Lord, as he began it with Father, it would haue ≈øeemed that he had called vpon Gods iu≈øtice &amp; power, &amp; not vpon his wil &amp; mercy: &amp; therfore in ≈øaying, Father, he intreated him that hee would not iudge as a Lord of iu≈øtice, but like a father of mercy. O depth of all goodnes! O bowels full of charity! what els did≈øt thou meane when thou beganne≈øt thy petition with Father, but that thou woulde≈øt giue him to thy enemies for a father who is thine owne proper father? what goodnes in all the world can be equall vnto thine, or what like charity can be found, ≈øeeing thou art the plaintife &amp; the party offended, yet thou gaue≈øt him vnto thy enemies for a mercifull father, whom thou ≈øhould≈øt haue giuen for a rigorous iudge?

The hatred which tho≈øe wicked Iewes bate vnto Chri≈øt was ≈øo great, that ≈øometimes they de≈øired nothing more then to ≈øee him yeeld vp the gho≈øt, and ≈øometime they were neuer ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied and full in doing him iniury, in≈øomuch that if they did crucifie him with their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ds, they did al≈øo crucifie him much more with their hearts. Wee ≈øhould haue great compa≈øsion vpon the Iewi≈øh nation which doe prolong their iniquity vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the end of the world: for as the Apo≈øtle ≈øayth, the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue ≈øhall neuer be all lightened vntill all the Gentiles bee conuerted. It may be ≈øaid not only of the Hebrewes, but al≈øo of many Chri≈øtians, that <hi>Prolong auerunt iniquitatem ≈øuam,</hi> who in ≈øtead of amending them≈øelues, goe on euery day em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing them≈øelues, ≈øo that they are like vnto tho≈øe which are ≈øick of the drop≈øie, who the more they drinke the more they thir≈øt; ≈øo they the more they ≈øinne the greater lu≈øt they haue to ≈øinne. And as Chri≈øt with great rea≈øon ≈øaid, that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes did prolong their iniquitie again≈øt him, with the like rea≈øon may they ≈øay of Chri≈øt, that towards them he prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his mercy, ≈øeeing he was as ha≈øtie in procuring their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, as they were in cau≈øing his pa≈øsion. What ≈øhold become of me O ≈øweet Ie≈øus, what ≈øhould become of me ≈øaith <hi>An≈øel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> if as euery day I adde naughtine≈ø≈øe to naughtine≈ø≈øe, and ≈øo prolong my iniquitie, thou didde≈øt not adde goodnes vnto goodne≈ø≈øe, and ≈øo prolong mee thy <hi>mi≈øericordiam?</hi> O ≈øweet Ie≈øus and my ≈øoules delight, of whom may it ≈øo truly be ≈øaid as of thee, that thou ha≈øt prolonged thy mercy, ≈øeeing that thou wa≈øt vpon the cro≈ø≈øe as it were gaping for death, and yet pardoning thy enemies? And although I doe euery day pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long my iniquity, and thou euery moment prolong thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, notwith≈øtanding thy mercy exceedeth my iniquitie: for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi≈øe my ≈øorrowfull ≈øoule ≈øhould long agoe haue knowne what thy rigorous iu≈øtice had beene. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ≈øaith vpon the pa≈øsion of our Lord, that hee hath much more prolonged his mercy, ≈øeeing hee ≈øaid not in his praier, Father forgiue them if
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3666:21"/>thou wilt, but ab≈øolutely that hee would forgiue them; and that not by the rigour of iu≈øtice due vnto them, but by the ≈øole mercy of him which made the petition. Behold then O my ≈øoule, behold that with greater deuotion &amp; affection the ≈øonne of God praied for thee vpon the cro≈ø≈øe than hee did for him≈øelfe in the garden, ≈øeeing that he ≈øaid there, Father if thou wilt, let that chalice pa≈ø≈øe; but on the cro≈ø≈øe he ≈øaid not If thou wilt, but Father forgiue them. In ≈øo much that it ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that hee left the care of his pa≈øsion vnto the will of his father, but the pardon of his enemies hee de≈øired pre≈øently to be giuen. What meaneth this O ≈øweet Ie≈øus, what meaneth this? It ≈øeemeth that thou doe≈øt put it in con≈øultation whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou ≈øhalt die or not, ≈øaying vnto him Father if thou wilt; and doe≈øt thou not giue thy father leaue to thinke whether he ≈øhall pardon that wicked people or not, but that he ≈øhould there pre≈øently forgiue them? The ≈øonne of God ≈øaith vnto his father (as <hi>Gregory</hi> reports) Father forgiue them, and not If thou wilt, becau≈øe we ≈øhould vnder≈øtand that when wee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue and be reconciled vnto our enemies, we ≈øhould doe it ≈øo ≈øincerely and heartily, and with ≈øuch good wil that we ≈øhould neuer turne our face from them, nor neuer deny them our communication. I will not (≈øaith <hi>Hugo</hi>) call that a Chri≈øtian forgiuing, when we forgiue our enemy vnder condition neuer to ≈øpeake vnto him, nor goe by his gate, nor dwell where hee hath to doe: for our redeemer excepted no condition in the pardon of his pa≈øsion. It is al≈øo deepely to bee weighed, that the ≈øonne of God did not ≈øay vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, Father forgiue him, but Father forgiue them: That is, he asked forgiuene≈ø≈øe not for one in particular, but for all the whole world in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. Whereof it is inferred that ≈øeeing hee praied for all, that there was ≈øinne in all. When Chri≈øt ≈øaid Pardon them and not pardon him, he gaue cau≈øe of great hope vnto all ≈øinners, that they ≈øhould bee pardoned by him, ≈øeeing hee forgot not to redeeme any, nor to pardon any man, nor leaue out any man not ≈øpoken for of his father, but made all men partakers of his pa≈øsion.

He ≈øaid not vnto <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> thy ≈øinne is relea≈øed, but thy ≈øinnes are forgiuen thee: In ≈øo much that in matter of ≈øinnes God cannot but either wholly winck at them, or wholly pardon them. For as S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ≈øayth, No man euer heard the ≈øonne of God ≈øay, I pardon thee ≈øuch a ≈øinne or this ≈øinne or that ≈øinne, but hee alwaies ≈øaid I par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thee all thy ≈øinnes, and therevpon praying vpon the cro≈ø≈øe vnto his father, hee did not ≈øay Pardon him, but ≈øaid Father pardon them. For it ≈øeemed vnto him, that the value of the bloud which hee ≈øhed, was of ≈øuch price, that tho≈øe for whome hee died were but few, although hee died for tho≈øe which were ab≈øent, as well as for tho≈øe which were pre≈øent, for the quicke and for the dead, for tho≈øe which were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy pa≈øt and for tho≈øe which were to come, for the iu≈øt and for the ≈øinners; &amp; that one drop of his bloud which he ≈øhould ≈øhed, would bee ≈øufficient to redeeme a thou≈øand of worlds: and if this were ≈øo, what rea≈øon had hee to be≈øtow it vpon one
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:3666:22"/>alone, ≈øeeing there did abound for all the world? The ≈øonne of God debated not the matter, nor plaied not the huck≈øter with his father in contending, how much bloud ≈øhall I giue thee for their pardon; becau≈øe he would let vs vnder≈øtand in this, that he paied very well, yea and repaied for al the ≈øinnes which were forgiuen. For to conclude, all the ≈øinnes in the world might haue ben numbred, but the price of the bloud of Chri≈øt could not bee valued. O good Ie≈øus! O my ≈øoules hope, if in fauour of great ≈øinners thou didde≈øt ≈øay, Father forgiue them, why doe≈øt thou not ≈øay in my behalfe who am a great ≈øinner, <hi>Pater igno≈øce illi,</hi> Forgiue him? If the Iewes haue beene vngratefull towards thee for the miracles which thou didde≈øt among≈øt them, haue not I been much more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull for the benefites receiued of thee?

O ≈øweet Ie≈øus how can≈øt thou ≈øay that thou wa≈øt not offended nor iniured by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, being as thou wa≈øt iniuried &amp; crucified by their hands? and although thou do not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>plaine vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, nor reuenge thee on them, nor yet accu≈øe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>; yet O my redeemer why do≈øt thou excu≈øe them? <hi>Barnard</hi> ≈øaith, That the ≈øon of God was repleni≈øhed with ≈øuch great charity, and ≈øuch in≈øpeakable pity towards tho≈øe which crucified him, that he could not obtaine leaue of him≈øelfe to impute any fault vnto them, ≈øeeing he had charged him≈øelfe with the pain due for it. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ≈øaith, That ≈øeeing Chri≈øt was the true mediator, pacifier, &amp; ≈øtikler betwixt his father &amp; the world, it would haue beene euilly thought of to ≈øay, that any one of them were his enemies: and therevpon it is that ≈øeeing hee had no enemie there among≈øt them, hee had no
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3666:25"/>nece≈øsitie to ≈øay on the cro≈ø≈øe, I pardon them. If the ≈øonne of God (≈øaith S. <hi>Chry≈øostome</hi>) hanging vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, ≈øhould haue ≈øaid, I al≈øo pardon them, it would haue beene thought that hee receiued greater griefe for the torment which hee him≈øelfe ≈øuffered, than of the iniuries which were done vnto his father; which for a certentie was not ≈øo: for if it were po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible, Chri≈øt would more willingly returne againe into the world to die, than endure to ≈øee one iniury done vnto his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Who dare now, O good Ie≈øus (≈øaith S. <hi>Barnard</hi>) who dare aske a reuenge of the iniuries done vnto him, ≈øeeing thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de≈øt make ≈øuch ≈ømall account of tho≈øe which were done vnto thy ≈øelfe? Doe≈øt not thou recken of the cruell thornes which pierced thy holy head, and ≈øhall I make account of an angry word which my brother ≈øpeaketh again≈øt me? How ≈øhall I dare to ≈øay, that I haue enemies, ≈øeeing thou doe≈øt handle tho≈øe which nailed thee vnto the cro≈ø≈øe like brothers? It ought to be a ≈øtrange ≈øpeech in the mouth of a Chri≈øtian to ≈øay, This is my enemy; for in making thy brother thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, thou doe≈øt loo≈øe Chri≈øt, and cau≈øe≈øt him to be no more thy friend. It is much to be noted, that Chri≈øt entreated not his father to pardon them after they were dead, but asked that he would pardon them quickly, yea &amp; that very quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becau≈øe he would let vs vnder≈øtand, that the value of his precious blood was of ≈øuch great price, that at that in≈øtant that it began to be ≈øhedde, at the ≈øame time it began to doe good. The redeemer of the world would not leaue vs out of the fauor of his father, nor an enemy vnto any; in token wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hee came into the world, ≈øaying, <hi>Et in terra pax hominibus,</hi> Peace vnto men vpon earth: and went out of the world, ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Pater igno≈øce illis,</hi> Father forgiue them. The ≈øon of God (≈øaith <hi>Ca≈øsiodorus</hi> vpon the P≈øalms) is not like vnto the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this world, who leaue vnto their children a little wealth with much ≈øtrife, ≈øeeing that by that ≈øpeech of, Father forgiue them, hee redeemed vs with his blood, baptized vs with his teares, annointed vs with his ≈øweat, in≈øtructed vs with his doctrine, loo≈øed vs from the deuill, and reconciled
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3666:26"/>vs vnto his father. O how much are wee bound vnto thee, ≈øweet Ie≈øus, for praying vnto thy father that he would forgiue his enemies before and not after thy death, that is, before the teares of thy eies were dried vp, and whil≈øt the wounds of thy body were yet fre≈øh. What would haue become of mankind if Chri≈øt at his death had bin angry with vs? When he ≈øaid in his la≈øt Sermon, <hi>Pacem meam do vobis,</hi> I giue you my peace, What el≈øe meant he, but that he left vs reconciled vnto his father, and vnited vnto him≈øelfe? How could the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall father (≈øaith <hi>An≈øelmus</hi>) deny his ble≈ø≈øed ≈øonne the pardon which hee demaunded, ≈øeeing he asked it with ≈øuch milde wordes, with ≈øuch ≈øorrowfull teares, with ≈øuch fre≈øh wounds, with ≈øuch louing bowels, with ≈øuch continual ≈øighes, and with ≈øuch great and pa≈øsing griefe? Wee may then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that when Chri≈øt praied his father to pardon quickely and without delay, he teacheth vs, that before we die and go out of this life, it is conuenient for vs to pardon all iniuries; for otherwi≈øe tho≈øe in the other world ≈øhall haue great occa≈øion to weepe, which would not in this world ≈øpeedily forgiue.</p>

When good king <hi>Dauid</hi> cited <hi>Saul</hi> to appeare before the iudgement of God, <hi>Dauid</hi> could haue cut off his head if hee would, as hee did the gard of his garment: but yet hee would not doe it, becau≈øe hee did ≈øet more by Gods fauour than by <hi>Sauls</hi> euill will. <hi>Saul</hi> was a capitall enemie vnto king <hi>Dauid:</hi> hee cau≈øed him to flee his countrey, for≈øake his kindred, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued him of his riches, bani≈øhed him his court, ≈øeparated him from his wife, and proclaimed him to be his publike ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie.

Good king <hi>Dauid</hi> re≈øpected it not that <hi>Saul</hi> did abu≈øe his regall vnction and annointing, but onely becau≈øe that hee was annointed by a good Spirit, in ≈øo much that <hi>Dauid</hi> regarded it not that <hi>Saul</hi> was a mo≈øt wicked and naughtie king, but onely that God had made him a king. Thereupon Saint <hi>Ambro≈øe</hi> ≈øaith, and that very well, that according vnto the example of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:3666:27"/>
                  <hi>Dauid,</hi> thou oughte≈øt not to looke vnto the malice with the which thy enemy entreateth thee, but vnto the vnction wherewith he is made a Chri≈øtian: and whether he be a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian or not, thou art not the iudge of this bu≈øines, but he who is thy God and his, who is to puni≈øh the iniury which thou ha≈øt done vnto him, &amp; in him the reuengement which thou ha≈øt taken on thee. Comming then vnto our purpo≈øe: The words which <hi>Dauid</hi> ≈øpake vnto <hi>Saul,</hi> that is, Let our Lord be a iudge betwixt me and thee, the Sonne of God may ≈øay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Synagogue, and vnto all her children; and that hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ≈øhall bee the iudge betwixt them, as well of all the good which Chri≈øt did vnto the Synagogue, as of the hurt he hath receiued by her. Which of all the Angels if he would come downe vnto vs, which of the dead if hee could ri≈øe againe, what man, were hee neuer ≈øo wi≈øe, were able to number the multitude of benefits which were ceiued by him, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible torments which they gaue him? Let our Lord bee a iudge betwixt me and thee, O Synagogue (for no other can be) how much more greater my loue was, with the which I redeemed thee, than the torments which in my pa≈øsion thou gaue≈øt me, and that how thy hatred was far greater than all the cruelties thou v≈øed≈øt towards me. Therefore I call thee into iudgement, O Synagogue, before God, not to the end that he ≈øhould cha≈øti≈øe thee, but onely to iudge betwixt mee &amp; thee, how that there is no worke of pity and mercy which I left vndone for thee, and how there was no cruelty of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which thou did≈øt not a≈ø≈øay again≈øt mee. Speaking then more particularly of the pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> which the ≈øonne of God gaue the Hebrewes, it were rea≈øon to ≈øhew what they did to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerue it, and what mooued Chri≈øt to giue it; for by ≈øo much the more excellent &amp; bountifull is the pardon, by how much the le≈ø≈øer the occa≈øions were to giue it. The Iewes did Chri≈øt fiue notorious iniuries at the time of his death, the lea≈øt of all which, if it had bene throughly puni≈øhed, had de≈øerued not onely not to be pardoned, but al≈øo condemned into eternall fire. For (≈øaith <hi>Hilarius</hi>) what puni≈øhment worthy of their
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:3666:27"/>de≈øert can be giuen vnto them, who take away life from him which is the giuer of life? The fir≈øt wrong which they did vnto Chri≈øt was, that they crucified him through malice, not finding any fault in him at al: which appeareth plainly by that that they did let goe <hi>Barrabas</hi> the man≈ølaier, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ≈øonne of God; iudging him to bee an hone≈øter man who killed tho≈øe which liued, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> that great Prophet which rai≈øed vp tho≈øe which were dead. Chri≈øt was a giuer of alms, and <hi>Barrabas</hi> was a theefe; Chri≈øt was quiet and a peacema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and <hi>Barrabas</hi> a ≈øower of ≈øedition; Chri≈øt a great preacher, and <hi>Barrabas</hi> a great robber and a≈ø≈øailer of men by the high way; Chri≈øt a mai≈øter of all good men, and <hi>Barrabas</hi> a captain of all ≈øcandalous men: and yet notwith≈øtanding all this they condemned Chri≈øt to be put immediately to death, and ≈øent <hi>Barrabas</hi> home vnto his hou≈øe. O how wicked a dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d made you O yee Iews and peruer≈øe petition, in asking that he may liue which killeth tho≈øe which are aliue, and that hee ≈øhould die who rai≈øeth to life tho≈øe which were dead! Who is there in your citie, who can heale the ≈øicke and di≈øea≈øed, or rai≈øe the dead vnto life, if this Prophet die? So great was the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred which they bare vnto the ≈øon of God, that to heare him once named they were much troubled, &amp; in <hi>Barrabas</hi> name they much reioiced; which they ≈øhewed manife≈øtly when they cried al with one voice that <hi>Pilate</hi> ≈øhould deliuer them <hi>Barrabas,</hi> and crucifie Chri≈øt. O what a happy man ≈øhould I bee, if my loue towards thee were ≈øo great as their hatred was towards thee: for by that meanes as they tooke a wrong cour≈øe in chu≈øing <hi>Barrabas</hi> for them≈øelues, ≈øo I ≈øhould doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in making choi≈øe of thee for my ≈øelfe. It had not ben to haue beene maruelled at if they had erred in their choi≈øe, if <hi>Pilat</hi> had giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> their choi≈øe betwixt two theeues, or two mankillers, or other two ≈øtrangers vnto them: but giuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the choi≈øe betwixt an a≈ø≈øailing theefe, and a mo≈øt holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and they pre≈øently to chu≈øe the wicked one, &amp; v≈øe iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice again≈øt the good one, it could not bee but they did it through great want of wi≈øedome and greater abundance of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:3666:28"/>malice. The ≈øecond iniury was, that if they had put the ≈øonne of God to death in ≈øome mean village, it would not haue ben ≈øo great an infamy and reproch vnto him: but the excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated Iewes the better to reuenge them≈øelues vpon Chri≈øt and to put him to the greater ≈øhame, put him to death in the great city of Ieru≈øalem, where he was very well known by his preaching, &amp; allied vnto many honorable Per≈øons by con≈øan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity. What wrong like vnto this was euer done vnto any man, or what reproch comparable vnto this, that is, to lead him to bee crucified at the Mount of Caluary, through the ≈øame ≈øtreets which he was wont to pa≈ø≈øe through to the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to preach? <hi>Seneca</hi> ≈øayth, That it is a greater griefe then death it ≈øelfe to a man that is ≈øhamefa≈øt and of a valiant cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, to ≈øee him≈øelfe troden downe where he hath ben hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and contumeliou≈øly handled, where he hath been highly e≈øteemed: for he feeleth the pre≈øent torment and griefe, &amp; he greeueth and perceiueth that, which his enemies ≈øpeake. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the ≈øon of God was mighty in doing miracles, faire and amiable in his countenance, profitable in his doctrine, and a friend vnto the weale publicke, hee was beloued of all, and enuied of many; by rea≈øon whereof he greeued much at the open di≈øhonour they did him, and that publickly they tooke his life from him. What griefe could hee be free from, ≈øeeing him≈øelfe carried openly, and condemned vnto the death of the cro≈ø≈øe, &amp; that his friends accompanied him weeping, and his enemies ≈øcorning &amp; mocking him? The third was, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they could haue put him to death ≈øecretly in his cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or in ≈øome darke night, yet they neuer ment once to do it; but they brought him forth at one of the clocke, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him at three, they crucified him at ≈øix, &amp; they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him at nine. It was not for want of dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ce, but through abundance of malice that they cho≈øe that houre, becau≈øe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the ≈øunne ≈øheweth his beames mo≈øt brighte≈øt, &amp; mo≈øt people pa≈ø≈øe through the ≈øtreets. <hi>Chri≈øo≈øtome</hi> vpon S. <hi>Matthew</hi> ≈øayth, That the Iews would not put Chri≈øt to death in the morning becau≈øe all men were not vp, nor in the night becau≈øe all were

S. <hi>Ciprian</hi> ≈øaith, That when the Iews put Chri≈øt to death, they were not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tent only to make choice of a bright day &amp; cleare, but al≈øo they would haue a long day (as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>monly the daies are the 25 of March) becau≈øe they might haue time in one day to accu≈øe him, giue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on him, &amp; crucifie him. The 4. point was, that although they could haue put him to death alone, yet they would not do it without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>pany; &amp; the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>pany they gaue him was not of hone≈øt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, but of two arrand theeues.

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:3666:29"/>Prophet was, ≈øeeing that in compari≈øon of him the theeues were of a better life. Put the ca≈øe, ≈øaith S. <hi>Ierom,</hi> that al the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtimonies which they brought again≈øt Chri≈øt had been true, and that they had proued by ≈øufficient witne≈ø≈øe tho≈øe crimes which they laid again≈øt him, yet notwith≈øtanding hee de≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not that kind of puni≈øhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t, nor to be executed with ≈øuch infamous theeues, becau≈øe the Imperiall laws doe command ≈øuch only to be partakers of equall puni≈øhment which were confederates in the offence. If the ≈øonne of God drew ≈øinners vnto him &amp; receiued them, truly it was not for that he would helpe them or further them in ≈øinne, but to draw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> to good life, in ≈øo much that by his ble≈ø≈øed company they were not peruerted but much more conuerted. The fifth wrong was, that although they might haue put him to another kind of death, which was not ≈øo ≈øcandalous to heare of, nor ≈øo cruell to bee endured as the death of the cro≈ø≈øe, yet they would put him to no other death but that, becau≈øe hee ≈øhould end his life with great cruelty &amp; ≈ømart. For the torment of the cro≈ø≈øe was holden to be the terrible≈øt that was to ≈øuffer, &amp; the lea≈øt pitifull to giue, and therefore they crucified none vnle≈ø≈øe it were ≈øuch a one as without amendment did breake the law, or ≈øuch a one as dur≈øt be a traitor to the king. Was hee pardie a breaker of the law, who ≈øaid openly <hi>Non veni ≈øoluere legem ≈øed adimplere:</hi> I came not to breake the law, but to fulfill the law? Is he pardy a traitor who ≈øaid openly, <hi>Reddite quae ≈øunt Cae≈øaris Cae≈øari,</hi> Giue that which is <hi>Cae≈øars</hi> vnto <hi>Cae≈øar,</hi> and that which is Chri≈øts vnto Chri≈øt? They &amp; not the ≈øonne of God were breakers of the law, they were Traitors vnto the king, they cau≈øed ≈øedition among the people, yea they ≈øtole away the ≈øacrifices: in ≈øo much that again≈øt all order of iu≈øtice, tho≈øe tran≈øgre≈ø≈øors murdered him which was holy, the Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors put to death him who was loiall, the guiltie crucified the innocent, and the theeues crucified their iudge. <hi>Chri≈øo≈øtome</hi> ≈øayth, That as the hatred which they bare vnto Chri≈øt did pa≈ø≈øe al other hatred in the world, and as the enuie they bare Chri≈øt was far greater then any other which could ≈øinke into

As touching the fir≈øt, they entreat <hi>Pilat</hi> to put Chri≈øt to death, and <hi>Pilat</hi> ≈øaid, that he found no cau≈øe in him why hee ≈øhould die: but in fine, his re≈øi≈øtance preuailed not ≈øo much as their importunity.

They crucified him with their hearts, when with their hearts they hated and dete≈øted him, &amp; then they hated him with their hearts, when they diffamed his per≈øon, and di≈øcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited his doctrine, in ≈øo much that it was not without cau≈øe that they cried twi≈øe crucifie, crucifie him, ≈øeeing that at one time they tooke away his life, and blemi≈øhed his credit. And although <hi>Pilate</hi> ≈øhould haue been determined to put him to death, either by cutting his throat, or ca≈øting him into a well, or by hanging him, which are ea≈øier deaths to ≈øuffer, and le≈ø≈øe infamous to endure, yet the doggi≈øh Iews would not leaue it vnto <hi>Pilates</hi> arbitrement and free will, for feare lea≈øt he wold haue beene too pitifull in the maner of his death. When cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine words are doubled in holy ≈øcripture, it is a great ≈øigne of loue or hatred in tho≈øe which v≈øe them, as when Chri≈øt ≈øaid, <hi>De≈øiderio de≈øideraui,</hi> I haue de≈øired with de≈øire, and when he ≈øaid <hi>Martha, Martha,</hi> in which words he ≈øhewed the loue and affection which hee bare vnto his di≈øciples, and what tender loue he bare to <hi>Martha,</hi> who gue≈øted him in her hou≈øe.

The ≈øon of God (≈øaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma≈øceu</hi>) nor tho≈øe of his holy colledge, were not of tho≈øe poor which were trouble≈øome and importunate, becau≈øe he bu≈øied
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:3666:41"/>him≈øelfe more in preaching than in begging: for if they had no almes ≈øent vnto them, they did eate the eares of the come and the hearbs of the fields.

                     </gap>udas</hi> was a thiefe and that a great thiefe, becau≈øe that that which he ≈øtole was a holy thing, and a holy almes, and in a holy hou≈øe, and did belong vnto a holy per≈øon; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according vnto the law of God, that cannot be a ≈ømall theft which is done in a holy and ≈øacred place. Saint <hi>Augu≈øt.</hi> ≈øaith, that as the two mites which the poore old woman offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Temple were more acceptable vnto God than all the trea≈øures of the people, ≈øo our Lord is more offended with a little which is taken out of the Temple, than with a great deale ≈øtollen in the world. <hi>Benauenture</hi> ≈øaith, that <hi>Iudas</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:3666:42"/>did not condemne him≈øelfe for the great quantitie which he ≈øtole, but becau≈øe it was a holy place from whence hee ≈øtole it, and therevpon it is, my religious brother, that thou maie≈øt offend more in taking a ≈ømall thing out of thy mona≈øtery, then a ≈øecular man in taking a greater out of the market. Why ≈øhould any man meruell, that the Scripture calleth vnhappie <hi>Iudas</hi> a theefe, ≈øeeing hee ≈øtole away the life and goods from the king of glory? <hi>Iudas</hi> ≈øold Chri≈øts life for many, he put Chri≈øts fame and credit to pledge with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and hee put Chri≈øts wealth into his pur≈øes: in ≈øo much that if Chri≈øt more had had, more this theefe would haue robbed. O good Ie≈øus, O redeemer of my ≈øoule, if I were <hi>Iudas,</hi> or <hi>Iudas</hi> were as I am, I would neuer haue pledged thy honour and credit, nor haue ≈øold thy life: that which I would haue ≈øtolne ≈øhould haue beene the humilitie the which thou didde≈øt liue with, the patience which thou didde≈øt ≈øpeake with, and the charitie which thou did≈øt forgiue with, and the zeale which thou didde≈øt preach with. O what a happy theefe ≈øhould I be if I could rob all the≈øe vertues from thee, ≈øeeing that in ≈øtead of the≈øe thefts heauen gates would be open vnto me. The third accu≈øation is, that wicked <hi>Iudas Habebat loculos,</hi> that is, had a pur≈øe with litle pur≈øes in it to hide the pence which he had ≈øtolne. Rich couetous men are wont to put their double duckats in one pur≈øe, the ≈øingle in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ≈øhillings in another, and their ≈ømall money in another, becau≈øe they may find them quickly, and count them ea≈øily. Wherein ≈øaith <hi>Seneca</hi> doth the felicity of couetous men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt, but in ≈øeeing euery houre their pur≈øe, counting their money, alwaies hoording vp ≈øomewhat, and in ≈øtudieng how they may le≈ø≈øen their ordinary charges? <hi>Aymon</hi> noteth, That the Scripture ≈øayth not, that <hi>Iudas</hi> had pur≈øes, but little pur≈øes, whereby is gathered Chri≈øts and his colledges great pouertie, ≈øeeing that all which that theefe ≈øtole was but ≈ømall ba≈øe money which might well bee contained in ≈ømall pur≈øes. Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> noteth, That there was ≈øo little money in Chri≈øts family, that there was not enough to ≈øtuffe a

O happy time, O golden age of the primitiue Church in the which there was but one pur≈øe among them all: but now ala≈ø≈øe that not among worldlings, but al≈øo among them which profe≈ø≈øe a mona≈øticall life, there is ≈øcar≈øe any one which hath not with <hi>Iudas</hi> his ≈ømall pur≈øes to keepe his own money in. And hee ≈øaith further, tell me traiterous Monke, tell mee thou Monke which ha≈øt propertie in thinges, what difference is betwixt thee which ≈øteale≈øt the reuenues of thy Mona≈øtery, and the Traitor <hi>Iudas</hi> which ≈øtole the almes from Chri≈øt? <hi>An≈øelmus</hi> ≈øayth, That as all perfect men are more bound vnto ≈øtraight v≈øes, than all other worldlings, I dare affirme that hee hath ≈øecret pur≈øes hidden with <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> which in his cell fo≈øtereth di≈øordinate and ≈øuperfluous appetites. Saint <hi>Ba≈øil</hi> in his Rule ≈øayth, As it is a greater perfection in a religious per≈øon to want his owne will, than to want any kind of money, yet wee may ≈øay of ≈øuch a one that it is more daungerous for him to bee mutinous again≈øt his ≈øuperiour, then to haue his pur≈øe full of money. Now thou art to vnder≈øtand my religious brother, that <hi>Iudas</hi> did not ≈øo much damne him≈øelfe for the money which he carried, as he did becau≈øe he did what he lu≈øted. It is an euill thing to beare the pur≈øe, but it is farre wor≈øe to bee wedded vnto a mans owne will: it is a bad thing to carry pur≈øes with money, but far wor≈øe to fulfill a mans owne appetites, becau≈øe there is no ≈øin which burneth ≈øo much in hell as the ≈øin of a mans owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per will.</p>

This is a high praier which the Prophet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, con≈øidering that hee doeth capitulate and agree with God, and God with him, that he will ≈øerue our Lord, &amp; that our Lord will haue charge ouer him. It is much to bee noted with <hi>Ca≈øsiodorus</hi> vpon the P≈øalmes, that the Prophet doth not only ≈øay, Doe not for≈øake mee, but he addeth al≈øo <hi>V≈øque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaque,</hi> that is, that hee would not for≈øake him all his life, and al≈øo that he would giue him his helping hand in all that hee ≈øhall goe about. O good Ie≈øus, O the loue of my ≈øoule, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeech thee, that if thou doe ≈øuffer me to fall into any ≈øin, yet that thou woulde≈øt not for≈øake me, <hi>V≈øquequaque,</hi> Alwaies or continually, and let me commit all ≈øinne, for if thou doe not hold mee with thy mercifull hand, where ≈øhall I ≈øtop but in the pains of hel? Our Lord hath held many with his hands, as <hi>Cain, Heli, Saule,</hi> and <hi>Mana≈ø≈øes;</hi> but hee did not hold them <hi>V≈øquequaque,</hi> that is ≈øtill, and all in all vntill the end; con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the one ≈ølew his brother, the other lo≈øt his Prie≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, the other was depriued of his kingdome, and the other died a Pagan. Hee did al≈øo for≈øake <hi>Dauid</hi> in his adultery, S. <hi>Peter</hi> when hee denied him, <hi>Paul</hi> when hee per≈øecuted him;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:3666:43"/>but he did not for≈øake them, <hi>V≈øquequaque,</hi> that is, vntil death; for of great ≈øinners they became very holy and cho≈øen men. O what a ≈øingular fauour, ≈øayth S. <hi>Ba≈øil</hi> vpon the P≈øalmes, our Lord doth vnto tho≈øe whome he doth not vtterly for≈øake, as he neuer doth his be≈øt friends; the which although they bee euilly handled, and ≈øuffer much, yet hee doth it rather to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øe them, then to for≈øake them. The vnhappy and vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate <hi>Iudas</hi> cannot ≈øay truly vnto our Lord, leaue me not for euer, becau≈øe his ≈øinnes were ≈øo great and his offences ≈øo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, that he was for≈øaken of Gods hands vtterly, &amp; he made him≈øelfe wholly vnworthy of Gods mercy and clemency. Was not the traitor <hi>Iudas</hi> vtterly for≈øaken thinke you, ≈øeeing that he ≈øold our Lord &amp; ma≈øter vpon the Wedne≈øday, &amp; vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Friday after he hanged him≈øelfe vpon a tree? Doe not for≈øake mee O good Ie≈øus, doe not for≈øake me <hi>V≈øquequaque,</hi> for euer: but if thou wilt for≈øake me for a time, and withdraw thy helping hand from mee, forget mee no longer then thou didde≈øt forget S. <hi>Peter,</hi> which was vntill hee wept; and doe not forget mee as thou didde≈øt <hi>Iudas,</hi> vntill hee hanged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe. The ≈øcripture accu≈øeth <hi>Iudas</hi> that he had noregard vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the needy and poore, but that he was more careful to ≈øteal ≈øomewhat from the almes which was giuen vnto Chri≈øt, then to bee pitifull vpon the poore and nece≈øsities which were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people. <hi>Su≈øpirabam, ligatus ≈øum non cathenis ferreis, ≈øed me a praua voluntate,</hi> ≈øaith Saint <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> in the eighth of his Confe≈øsions, as if he would ≈øay; O how many times did I pierce the heauens with ≈øighes, and watered the fields with my teares, ≈øeeing my ≈øelfe taken and bound in yrons, and yet not with fetters and cheines, but with my own proper wicked vvill: and that vvhich I cannot ≈øpeake vvithout vveping is, that I yeelded my owne will vnto the enemie, and with my vvill he doth that vvhich is not my will. Who euer vttered ≈øuch pitifull vvords vntill this day? O vvith vvhat great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon this holy man ≈øpeaketh this, and vvith vvhat greatrea≈øon hee vveepeth for giuing our vvill vnto the deuill, ≈øeeing hee maketh of our vvill that vvhich vve vvill not: for if vve giue
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:3666:44"/>the enemy once an entrance into our ≈øoule, he rebelleth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently with the chiefe≈øt force hee hath, <hi>Iudas</hi> gaue principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his will vnto the deuill, and hee in lieu of his will, taught him to murmure, and hauing taught him to murmure hee v≈øed him to ≈øteale, and hauing v≈øed to ≈øteale he began to haue pur≈øes, and that being done hee came to ≈øell Chri≈øt for coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tou≈øne≈ø≈øe. What would the Prophet ≈øay when hee ≈øaith, <hi>aby≈ø≈øus abi≈ø≈øum inuocat,</hi> One depth calleth another, but that the qualitie of one ≈øinne is to call another vnto him. <hi>Augu≈øt.</hi> vpon the P≈øalmes ≈øaith; King <hi>Dauid</hi> ≈øaith very well that one ≈øinne enti≈øeth another, con≈øidering that of idlene≈ø≈øe commeth looking, of looking de≈øiring, of de≈øiring con≈øenting, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øenting doing, of doing per≈øeuering, of per≈øeuering damning him≈øelfe, in ≈øo much that wee goe from ≈øinne vnto ≈øin in po≈øt ha≈øt, vntill we be benighted in hell. <hi>Iucundus home qui mi≈øere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, &amp; commodat, &amp;c.</hi> ≈øaith <hi>Dauid</hi> in his hundred &amp; eleuenth P≈øalme, as if hee would ≈øay. O how happy is that man who is pitiful with the weake, a giuer of almes vnto the poore, and mode≈øt in that which hee ≈øpeaketh: for although God ≈øuffer ≈øuch a one to be tempted, yet hee ≈øuffereth him not to bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> vpon the≈øe words ≈øaith, If thou marke it well, there is no man called plea≈øant and faire in Scripture, but hee which v≈øeth pitie, and giueth almes, and hee who mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>reth his words before hee vtterthem; for ≈øuch a one is in fauour with God, and e≈øteemed among men. Who hath ben mercifull vnto his brother in this world, vnto whom God hath not beene the like in the other? who hath imparted his goods vnto the poor, vnto whom God hath not imparted his glory? who hath brideled his tongue, who hath not benregar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded &amp; re≈øpected for it? What greater reward would he haue which v≈øeth mercy, or he which giueth alms of his ≈øub≈øtance or he who hurteth no man with his tongue, then that oth and promi≈øe which the Prophet ≈øpeaketh of, <hi>Qu√≤d in aternum non commouebitur,</hi> that although he be neuer ≈øo much vexed and beaten with temptations, yet our Lord will not ≈øuffer him to be ouerthrown. S. <hi>Barnard</hi> ≈øaith vpon <hi>Qui habitat,</hi> O good Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:3666:44"/>O the glory of my ≈øoul, if my hart be a≈ø≈øured by thee that he ≈øhal not bee moued for euer, what doe I weigh it if pride beate me, if anger moue mee, if enuy mole≈øt me, yea and the fle≈øh di≈øquiet me? when our Lord asketh of vs that we would be merciful, &amp; alms giuers, &amp; fair ≈øpoken, it is a very ≈ømal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he asketh of vs, con≈øidering that which he doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe for it: for for to be a≈ø≈øured, that neither in aduer≈øity which may come vnto him, nor pro≈øperity which hee may happen vnto, <hi>Qu√≤d in aeternu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>,</hi> that his heart ≈øhall neuer bee moued, is ≈øuch a great matter that it can neither bee bought with the weight of tears, nor de≈øerued by heroicall deeds. The contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnto all this was found in wicked <hi>Iudas:</hi> for in ≈øteed of pitty he was cruel, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øidering how he had no regard vpon the poor, &amp; in ≈øtead of almes-giuing he ≈øtole the almes from Chri≈øt, &amp; in≈øtead of brideling his tongue he ≈øold his God &amp; Lord vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Synagogue; and how could <hi>Iudas</hi> the theefe haue pity on the poor which begged among the people, ≈øeeing he ≈øtole the alms which they gaue vnto Chri≈øt? If it be a ≈øin to ≈øteale from a rich man, yea that which hee aboundeth with; ≈øhall it not be a ≈øin &amp; a wicked ≈øacriledge to ≈øteale from the poor that which they haue nece≈øsity of? whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> tho≈øe of Chri≈øts holy col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge did eat the ears of corne for pure hunger, they would rather haue earen bread and meat if they had had money to buy it. If <hi>Iudas</hi> did ≈øee Chri≈øt deuide the apo≈øtles alms to the needy poor, he ≈øhould nor only not haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> it as a reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing &amp; di≈øhone≈øt, but rather he ≈øhould haue ben thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and glad for it, becau≈øe there is no worke of mercy which is not in this world comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ded, and in the other rewarded. It is a certaine thing that the eues wi≈øh not well vnto the poore, becau≈øe a theefe will neuer come to him whom he thinketh will aske ≈øomething of him, but vnto tho≈øe from whome they imagine they can ≈øteale ≈øomewhat away. <hi>Fulgentius</hi> ≈øaith in a ≈øermon; If ≈øorrowfull <hi>Iudas</hi> had beene loiall vnto his mai≈øter, mercifull vnto the poore, friendly with the Apo≈øtles, di≈øciplinable in his manners, and not de≈øirous of other mens goods, our Lord would neuer haue left him to haue gone
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3666:45"/>out of his colledge, nor hee euer haue committed trea≈øon. Who made thee O <hi>Iudas</hi> ≈øtumble and fall into ≈øuch enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and greeuous ≈øins, but thy ≈ømall or rather no pity? When the ≈øcripture accu≈øeth the traitor <hi>Iudas</hi> that he had no care of the needy, it is a matter both to make vs afeard, and al≈øo to wonder at; becau≈øe that in the ≈øight of our Lord, the almes which we doe vnto the poore are much more accepted, than the ≈øacrifice and incen≈øe which we offer him. <hi>Iudas</hi> is al≈øo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øed of that which hee did in the parlar where hee ≈øupped, when Chri≈øt ≈øaid. <hi>Ecce manus tradentis me,</hi> as if hee would ≈øay; O my di≈øciples, O my only ≈øons and companions, truly I open and di≈øcouer one thing vnto you: that is, that one of you which are here with me, hath ≈øold me by trea≈øon, and which is wor≈øt of all, hee doth eat with mee at my table and at my owne di≈øh. Chri≈øt complaineth that <hi>Iudas</hi> ≈øold him vnto the Synagogue, and that hee ≈øate at his table with him, and that he did eat with one hand only, and that he was a≈øhamed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the one nor of the other: and there is none of this ≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken without a great my≈øterie. <hi>Confundimini &amp; crube≈øcite ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per viis ve≈øtris √¥ domus I≈ørael,</hi> ≈øaid God by <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> chap. 6, as if hee would ≈øay: O hou≈øe of I≈ørael, O ye people of Iuda, bee now a≈øhamed of the filthy works which you doe, and of the wicked ≈øteps yee walke in. For I am much more offended to ≈øee how little you e≈øteeme of me, then of the offences which you commit again≈øt me. A man which is of a noble and ≈øtour courage, and of a ≈øhamefa≈øt countenance, although hee haue beene offended and wounded by another, yet he doth not ≈øo much feele the iniury which is done, as he greeueth to ≈øee his enemy walke before his hou≈øe; becau≈øe the brabble procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of anger, but the going about his hou≈øe commeth from malice. <hi>Gregory</hi> vpon <hi>Ezechiel</hi> ≈øaith thus, Our Lord had great rea≈øon to complain of the hou≈øe of I≈ørael, &amp; of the kingdome of Iuda, and that not ≈øo much for the wickedne≈ø≈øe they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, as for the ≈ømall ≈øhame they had in committing it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe that hee wil either late or neuer amend, which is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhamed at all to haue offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ded. It is to be noted that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3666:45"/>≈øaith, <hi>Erube≈øcite de vijs ve≈øtris,</hi> that is, that we ≈øhould bee a≈øhamed to walke our waies, becau≈øe to walke vnto the fle≈øh and the world there are many waies, which are all of vanity: but to walke vnto heauen there is but one way, which is of charity. What are our waies but onely our di≈øordinate and naughty de≈øires? Whither doe our de≈øires lead vs, but vnto vices, and from vices vnto ≈øins, and from ≈øins vnto hell? Then be a≈øhamed to ≈øinne or to haue ≈øinned: for as S. <hi>Ambro≈øe</hi> ≈øaith, The fir≈øt ≈øtep to repentance is to bee a≈øhamed of the ≈øinne committed. What ≈øaith the ≈øon of God, when hee ≈øaith, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the hand of him which betraieth me: what el≈øe doth he ≈øay tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, behold the Traitor, behold wicked <hi>Iudas,</hi> who is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tent to haue ≈øold me vnto the ≈øynagogue, but al≈øo ≈øitteth &amp; eateth at my table without any ≈øhame at all. The ≈øon of God could not haue ≈øpoken a word of greater iniury to <hi>Iudas</hi> than to call him Traitour: for after a man hath committed trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon again≈øt another, there is neuer after any hope to be had of him, nor tru≈øt to bee put in him. <hi>Iudas</hi> was a Traitor in ≈øel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Chri≈øt vnto tho≈øe vnto whome hee did ≈øell him: that is, vnto his mortall enemies, who bought him not becau≈øe hee ≈øhould ≈øerue them, but becau≈øe they would bee reuenged on him. <hi>Iudas</hi> was a traitor, for ≈øelling Chri≈øt for ≈øo ba≈øe and vile a price, becau≈øe a lu≈øtie and an able young man, as Chri≈øt was, was more worth if it had beene but to make a ≈ølaue of. <hi>Iudas</hi> was a Traitor in ≈øelling him vnto them, becau≈øe in doing of it he ≈øhewed great malice, and exceeding auarice, ≈øeeing hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with his enemies for him at the fir≈øt word, &amp; hee neuer replied nor hucked one word vpon the ≈øale. <hi>Iudas</hi> was al≈øo a traitor, becau≈øe he went of his own voluntary wil to ≈øel Chri≈øt, not being asked nor induced vnto it by any, wherein he ≈øhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his infamous condition &amp; wicked trea≈øon. For by ≈øo much the more ≈øins are offen≈øiue, by how much the occa≈øions were le≈ø≈øe which cau≈øed vs to commit them. <hi>Iudas</hi> was al≈øo a Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in ≈øitting with Chri≈øt at his table, as though he had offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him in nothing: vvherein he ≈øhewed his ≈ømall con≈øcience and great impudency; for hauing as hee had the money in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:3666:46"/>his pur≈øe, for the which he ≈øold Chri≈øt, it was not rea≈øon hee ≈øhould haue eaten with him in his di≈øh. <hi>Remigius</hi> exclaimeth in an epi≈øtle: O vnto how many may Chri≈øt ≈øay now adaies, behold the hand of him which betraieth mee is at the table with me, all which like vnto <hi>Iudas</hi> either by v≈øury, or by ≈øy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony dare ≈øell Chri≈øt, and after eat with him at the ≈øame me≈ø≈øe, prophaning and wa≈øting church-goods, as though they had co≈øt Chri≈øt nothing! S. <hi>Augu≈øt.</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ≈øayth, That there ≈øupped but one Traitor in the parlar with Chri≈øt, but now adaies in the table of his church there dineth &amp; ≈øuppeth an infinit number of Traitors: and that which cannot be ≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken without tears is, that neuer ≈øeruing nor benefiting the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church at all, they eat and take away the fruit which Chri≈øt got vs with his precious bloud. Tell mee my brother, tell mee I pray thee, what difference is there betwixt thee which ≈øelleth Chri≈øt for ≈øinnes, and <hi>Iudas</hi> which ≈øold him for money? Is it not thinke≈øt thou a greater ≈øinne to ≈øell Chri≈øt for other ≈øinnes, then for <hi>Iudas</hi> to ≈øell him for thirty peeces of money? The difference which I find betwixt thee who art a ≈øinner, and wicked <hi>Iudas</hi> who was a Traitor is, that hee ≈øold Chri≈øt but once, and thou ≈øelle≈øt him euery day and houre: and in ≈øo greeuous an offence there can be nothing more iu≈øt, that ≈øeeing thy trea≈øon is greater than his, that thy condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation al≈øo ≈øhould be greater than his. It is al≈øo to be weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Chri≈øt doth not ≈øay that <hi>Iudas</hi> did eat with him with both hands, but with one only; for hee ≈øaith: <hi>Ecce manum tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentis me;</hi> Behold the hand of him who betraieth me, which hee ≈øpake not without a ≈øecret my≈øterie. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ≈øayth thus, He who could haue ≈øeene <hi>Iudas</hi> in the parlar, ≈øhould haue ≈øeene how his heart was giuen to the deuill, his body vnto the world, his word vnto the Synagogue, his left hand vpon his pur≈øe, and with his right hand hee did eat with Chri≈øt. <hi>Vbertinus</hi> ≈øayth, That he doth eat with the Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>Iudas</hi> at the table with one hand, who liueth in a mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtery, not with a purpo≈øe to follow Chri≈øt, but with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to flee the perils of the world, and coker him≈øelfe with
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:3666:46"/>the goods of the mona≈øtery. <hi>Bonauenture</hi> ≈øayth, That then the religious man eateth with one handwith <hi>Iudas</hi> at Chri≈øts table, when he liueth in the mona≈øtery by nece≈øsitie, and not voluntarily, in≈øomuch that his body is in his cell, &amp; his heart in the market place. Thus then you haue had recited vnto you the heinous offences, which the Traitor <hi>Iudas</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and how iu≈øtly our Lord condemned him: ≈øo that now there remaineth onely to tell you of the perfections which were in the good theefe which died with Chri≈øt, and how iu≈øtly Chri≈øt tooke him to heauen with him.</p>

S. <hi>Ambro≈øe</hi> vpon the P≈øalmes ≈øayth, O vvhat a difference there is betwixt the vvrath of God, &amp; the vvrath of man, for they puni≈øh vvhen they are angry, but God forbeareth to puni≈øh vvhen hee is angry, in ≈øo much that God is more di≈øplea≈øed vvhen hee di≈ø≈øembleth a fault than vvhen he doth pre≈øently puni≈øh.

For as there is ≈ømall hope of the ≈øick mans life vvhome the Phi≈øition doth di≈øtru≈øt and de≈øpaire of, euen ≈øo in like manner there is great occa≈øion to ≈øu≈øpect the ≈øalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that man vvhom our Lord doth not puni≈øh in this life.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:3666:59"/>It is al≈øo to be noted, that <hi>E≈øay</hi> doth not only threaten Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øalem, becau≈øe ≈øhe dronk of the cup of the ire of God, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe ≈øhe drunke al≈øo the dregs and lees, vntill ≈øhee left none, in ≈øo much that if there had ben more, more ≈øhe would haue drunk. We call that properly the dregs of the wine, that part of the wine which corrupteth and marreth, and that which goeth to the bottome, and that which rotteth and ≈øtinketh, and that whereof we receiue no profite. What are the dregs which ≈øinke vnto the bottome, but onely wicked ≈øinne which beareth vs into hell? The dregs of ≈øinne cau≈øe vs to rot, and with dregs of ≈øinne we ≈øinke, and by the dregs of ≈øinne we are damned, and by the dregs of ≈øin we are hated of God. I will vi≈øite Ieru≈øalem and tho≈øe men which are fa≈øtened in their dregs, ≈øaith God by the Prophet <hi>Sophonias</hi> in the fir≈øt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as if hee would ≈øay, I will vi≈øite all the dwellers of Ieru≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and I will make no reckoning of other ≈øinnes and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but of ≈øuch as I ≈øhall find entangled, and tumbling in the dregs and lees. Who are tho≈øe which ≈øticke in the mire &amp; are bedurted with the dregs, but tho≈øe which ≈øtand ob≈øtinately in their ≈øinnes and wickedne≈ø≈øe? God complaineth not of tho≈øe which are defiled in the dregs, but on tho≈øe which are fa≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and fixed in them: for our Lord is not ≈øo much ≈øcandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to ≈øee vs fall into ≈øinnes, as to ≈øee vs wallow and delight in their dregs and grounds. O that wicked is the heart which is fa≈øtened, and ≈øtandeth firme in the dregs of ≈øinne, becau≈øe promi≈øes cannot allure and enti≈øe him, nor threatnings feare him, nor entreatie conuert him, nor puni≈øhment amend him, nor coun≈øell profite him!

To drinke of the cup vnto the dregs is, as if as there are but ≈øeuen capitall ≈øins they were feuen thou≈øand, to haue a will to offend in them all before we died. To drinke vnto the dregs is, that if by deed we commit

To drinke the cup vnto the dregs is, that if wee omit to commit any ≈øinne, it is not becau≈øe wee would not, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe we could not or dur≈øt not. To drinke of the cup vnto the dregs is, that not being content to ≈øinne, we commend and prai≈øe our ≈øelues for doing it, as if we had done our Lord ≈øome notable ≈øeruice. To drinke the cup vnto the dregs is, that when wee haue committed all kind of ≈øinnes, yet wee cannot endure to be called ≈øinners. To drinke the cup vnto the dregs is, to be ≈øo gracele≈ø≈øe and ≈øhamele≈ø≈øe in ≈øinning, that we enti≈øe and importunately vrge others to do the like. To drinke the cup vnto the dregs, is to hate our neighbour with our heart, iuiurie him with words, and hurt him in deeds. Loe thus then haue I told you what is the cup of bitternes which the elect and cho≈øen drinke of, and which is the cup of wrath and ire which the wicked drinke of: in ≈øo much that if wee would know who ≈øhall bee ≈øaued, or who damned, wee are onely to mark what cup he dranke of. To come then vnto our purpo≈øe, we mu≈øt ≈øuppo≈øe that the≈øe two theeues drank of both the≈øe cups, which are ≈øo dreadfull and wonderfull; and ≈øuch as the cup was, of which ech of them dranke, ≈øuch was the reward or puni≈øhment which on the cro≈ø≈øe ech of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> receiued and carried away.

In figure of all this, the altar of the Synagogue was all hollow, but the altar of the church is ma≈øsie and ≈øound, by rea≈øon of the feruent loue which God beareth vs, and great charitie and mercy which hee doth vs. It is much to bee noted, that God doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend vnto vs, Faith, Hope, Patience, and Cha≈øtitie, but only Charitie: in which words hee giueth vs to vnder≈øtand, that if we doe ≈øet much by that which our Lord giueth vs, we ought to e≈øteeme much more of the loue with the which hee doth giue it vs. <hi>I≈øidorus</hi> ≈øayth, That all the courte≈øies which our Lord doth promi≈øe vs, and all the per≈øua≈øions vvhich hee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeth vnto vs, are to no other end, but becau≈øe vve ≈øhould bee thankfull vnto him, and becau≈øe vve ≈øhould be mercifull vnto our neighbours.

Wherein doe≈øt thou thinke (≈øaith S. <hi>Ierome</hi>) that all Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an charity doth con≈øi≈øt, and al the health of thy ≈øoule, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ≈øeruing of Chri≈øt with all our heart, and in labouring to profit and benefit our neighbour?

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:3666:64"/>Ie≈øus the light of my ≈øoule, I be≈øeech thee that thou take not thy zeale from mee, nor withdraw thy puni≈øhing hand from me; but as I commit a fault, ≈øo let thy puni≈øhment bee ready: for by this means I ≈øhall ≈øooner amend, &amp; liue al≈øo more wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. When the father of a company doth not puni≈øh a peruer≈øe ≈øeruant, it is a ≈øigne that he will put him out of the hou≈øe; and when they let a ≈øick man eat all things that he lu≈øteth, it is a ≈øign that he wil die: &amp; ≈øo whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> God doth let vs go with the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle loo≈øe in our own hand after what vices we lu≈øt, it is a token that wee goe altogether out of the way. O how indurate that man ought to be in ≈øin, and how he ought to be mired in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, of whom God ≈øayth, <hi>Auferetur zelus meusate!</hi> For when God ≈øaith that hee will not loue vs any more with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou≈øie, what doth hee mean el≈øe, but that he will be carele≈ø≈øe and forgetfull of vs, and for≈øake to puni≈øh vs? The holy ≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture maketh mention of two kinds of zeale; the one is holy and glorious, and it is that which God hath towards vs; &amp; the other is common, and is that zeale which wee beare towards our neighbours: and if the one be nece≈ø≈øary, the other is more nece≈ø≈øary, becau≈øe the true zeale and loue of our neighbour con≈øi≈øteth not ≈øo much in helping him to maintaine him≈øelfe, as in directing him to ≈øane his ≈øoule. S. <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> in a Sermon ≈øayth, What doth it auaile thee O my friend, that thou help thy neighbour in time of nece≈øsitie with thy money, if thou con≈øent vnto him and hee with thee to wallow in vices? O how far a greater good turne thou ≈øhoulde≈øt doe him in le≈ø≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his faults, than by augmenting his wealth, becau≈øe there is no greater riches vnder the heauen, than to haue a cleane con≈øcience! The good theefe had a great zeale that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øhould bee ≈øaued, ≈øeeing hee did rebuke him for being a bla≈øphemer, and per≈øuaded him to be a Chri≈øtian: in≈øomuch that for a recompence for helping him to ≈øteale, hee would al≈øo helpe him to die well. <hi>Chry≈øi≈øtome</hi> vpon this matter ≈øayth, The≈øe two theeues had kept companie a long time to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and deuided equally their prey betwixt them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe that as there was no difference betwixt them in the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:3666:64"/>fault, ≈øo they would haue equall ≈øhares in the deui≈øion. Now the good theefe would haue continued his old v≈øe, and as he had ≈øtolne heauen there vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, ≈øo he would haue deuided part of it vnto his companion, if the Lord of the theft, which was Chri≈øt, would haue con≈øented vnto it, or if the wretched theefe had de≈øerued it. O how great and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpeakable a charity was this of the good theeues! for con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that him≈øelfe was a Chri≈øtian, hee would haue made the other one al≈øo, and ≈øeeing him≈øelfe the heire of heauen, he would haue taken the other thither with him, and ≈øeeing him≈øelfe pardoned, hee would haue gotten pardon for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that hee would neither beleeue in Chri≈øt, nor with good will giue eare vnto his companion. It is much to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (≈øayth <hi>Chri≈øo≈øtome</hi>) that the good theefe ≈øaid fir≈øt vnto the bad, Neither thou doe≈øt feare God, before hee ≈øaid, Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me. For as I ≈øuppo≈øe, it helped much to ≈øaue the good theefe, that Chri≈øt ≈øaw with what great charity hee laboured that his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>panion ≈øhould not ca≈øt away him≈øelf. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> he ≈øaid fir≈øt in fauor of the other, Neither thou doe≈øt feare God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee ≈øpake in the behoofe of him≈øelfe, Lord remember me; is it not mo≈øt manife≈øt and clear, that he de≈øired as much that his companion ≈øhould bee conuerted, as him≈øelfe ≈øaued? <hi>Remigius</hi> ≈øayth, That among all the ≈øeruices which wee can doe vnto our Lord, there is none ≈øo great, as to help our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to ≈øaue him≈øelfe, and contrariwi≈øe, there is none that doth more offend him, than to helpe our neighbour to damn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe; becau≈øe it ≈øeemeth that wee make ≈ømall account of the ≈øhedding of his bloud, if we helpe him not to be≈øtow it well. Then we be≈øtow his glorious bloud well, when we cau≈øe it to benefit our brothers: for otherwi≈øe we may ≈øay, that it was wel ≈øhed by Chri≈øt, but euilly be≈øtowed by vs. What greater ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice can I doe vnto our Lord, than draw my neighbor from ≈øinne, who hath been redeemed by his precious bloud? The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> I draw my brother out of ≈øinne, when I correct him with my tongue, and help him in his worke. For as touching the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of our Lord, it is conuenient not only to adui≈øe &amp; coun≈øell
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:3666:65"/>him, but if we can al≈øo puni≈øh and cha≈øti≈øe him. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his booke of Martyrs ≈øayth, Who dare now adaies like vnto Phinees thru≈øt through with a poynyard a bold Iew and a ≈øhamele≈ø≈øe Gentile? Who like vnto holy <hi>Samuel</hi> will weepe for the di≈øobedience of <hi>Saule?</hi> Who like vnto holy <hi>Iob</hi> will ri≈øe earely in the morning to offer ≈øacrifices of peace for the ≈øinnes of his ≈øonnes? Who like vnto the High prie≈øt <hi>Aaron</hi> will threaten <hi>Pharaoh</hi> within his own pallace, becau≈øe hee ≈øhould leaue off the ≈øeruice of his God in the Synagogue? Who will lo≈øe the light of his eies like vnto the good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ieremy</hi> in weeping and taking pity vpon tho≈øe who carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away tho≈øe of Babilonia captiues? Now the zeale of holy men is lo≈øt, now the feruency of good men is at an end, now the puni≈øhment of naughty men is forgotten; for becau≈øe that in matter of correction, a friend will rather venter his con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with his friend, then ≈øuffer him to lo≈øe his credite. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is no credite, but a di≈øcredit, no charity but cruelty to ≈øuffer his neighbour to damne him≈øelfe for want of correcting him: for oftentimes naughty men would amend them≈øelues of their errors, if their friends which they haue, would aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti≈øe them of them. Seeing wee cannot auoid it, but ≈øtumble at euery foot, nor giue ouer ≈øinning more or le≈ø≈øe, why haue wee friends and companions, but becau≈øe they ≈øhould keepe vs vp with one hand from falling, and lift vs vp with the other, if they ≈øee vs downe? S. <hi>Barnard</hi> in an Epi≈øtle ≈øaith, Let no man leaue off the correcting of his neighbour and friend, becau≈øe he thinketh that by ≈øo doing, he doth di≈øplea≈øe him: for after he hath con≈øidered of the matter, hee ≈øhall perceiue that hee hath done a good worke; becau≈øe that oftentimes the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øell which they giue vs, is more worth tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the money which they lend vs.</p>

S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> vpon the words of our Lord ≈øayth, That in the trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant church loue without feare worketh; but in the militant church, loue and feare goe together: and a ≈øigne of this is that the greater loue I beare my friend, the greater feare I haue to di≈øplea≈øe him. <hi>Cyrillus</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ≈øaith, Although the ≈øon of God ≈øaid, <hi>Ignem veni mittere in terram,</hi> which was as much as to ≈øay, that he builded his church vpon loue, yet he tooke not his feare from her: becau≈øe that ≈øeeing that there is both mercy and iu≈øtice in God, wee are bound a≈øwell to feare his rightfull iu≈øtice, as we are to loue his mercy. When God gaue <hi>Moi≈øes</hi> the old law, hee gaue it him with great thunders and terrible lightnings, and with al mixed it with many threats, &amp;
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:3666:66"/>ordained it with many puni≈øhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ts: becau≈øe the Iews ≈øhould determine with them≈øelues to keepe it, and not in any wi≈øe to breake it. King <hi>Pharaoh</hi> commanded all the midwiues of the kingdome of Egypt to ≈ølay al the male children of the Iews at the time of their birth: and becau≈øe they would not doe it for fear of the Lord, the Lord gaue them great riches in their hou≈øes. The ≈øcripture commendeth very much a ≈øteward vvhich the king <hi>Achab</hi> had, vvho≈øe name vvas <hi>Abdias,</hi> the vvhich ≈øeeing the cur≈øed Queene <hi>Iezabel</hi> cut the throats of the Prophets of I≈ørael, did hide ≈øome number of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> vntill all the butchery vvas pa≈øt: the vvhich the good <hi>Abdias</hi> did not ≈øo much for the loue vvhich hee bore vnto the Prophets, as for the feare vvhich he bore vnto God. When king <hi>Io≈øaphat</hi> con≈øtituted iudges in all the cities of Iudea, he gaue them no other in≈øtruction, but that they ≈øhould feare God, and be very mindfull of the good of their Commonwealth, becau≈øe that by this means they ≈øhould bee well liked both of God and of all the people. The ≈øcripture reporteth of holy <hi>Tobias,</hi> that he began at the ≈øame time to weane his ≈øon, and fear the God of I≈ørael, and that hee contracted friend≈øhip vvith none nor none vvith him, vnle≈ø≈øe he knew that he feared God. S. <hi>Ierom</hi> vpon the Prophets ≈øayth, Al holy men and of great perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doe not only loue the Lord, and feare him as their Lord &amp; God, but doe al≈øo refu≈øe to conuer≈øe vvith tho≈øe vvhich vvill not fear our Lord: and for that cau≈øe <hi>Abraham</hi> went from the Caldeans, &amp; holy <hi>Lot</hi> fled from the Sodomites.

Becau≈øe that if an euil ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> might enioy the world, he would little care if heauen vvere taken from him. A vaine vvordly man engraued in a medall of gold the wordes of the

O cur≈øed tongue, and wicked ≈øpeech! what an vngodly mouth was that, which dur≈øt vtter ≈øuch horrible bla≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy? for by the rigor of iu≈øtice, he may iu≈øtly be caried into hel, who renounceth to go to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, and is wel plea≈øed to hue in the word. <hi>An≈øelmus</hi> ≈øaith, O what a great fauour God doth vnto that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> God doth not exclude fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> his loue, &amp; doth not leaue him without fear for the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> which hath both loue and feare in him, although he want other perfections, neither ought to fear, lea≈øt he ≈øhould be damned, nor di≈øtru≈øt at all to be ≈øaued. We haue ≈øpoken all this in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mendation of the good theef, &amp; of his piety &amp; charity, who did not rebuke the other theefe his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>pamon, for that hee was prowd or enuious, but only becau≈øe he did not feare God, ≈øaying <hi>Neque tu times deum,</hi> Neither doe≈øt thou fear God: Giuing vs to vnder≈øtand by this, that he went down right into hell, for no other cau≈øe, but becau≈øe he made ≈ømal reckoning of Chri≈øt. And it is much tobe noted why the good theef did not rebuke the other for that, that he did not loue Chri≈øt; as he did reprehend him, for that he did not fear Chri≈øt. <hi>Hilarius</hi> an≈øwereth this doubt and ≈øayth, That becau≈øe loue doth belong vnto tho≈øe vvhich are perfect, and feare vnto ≈øuch as are not ≈øo perfect, the good theefe did not per≈øuade the other that hee ≈øhould loue, but that he ≈øhould feare, becau≈øe the duty and office of louing, is of ≈øuch high quality, that although many goe about it, yet few attaine vnto it. Glorious Saint <hi>Peter</hi> did per≈øuade him≈øelfe that hee had loued Chri≈øt, as hee ought to haue loued him; and therevpon to take away his vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, Chri≈øt asked him three times whether hee loued human which deinand, Chir≈øt gaue vs to vnder≈øtand, that the merit of loued oth not con≈øi≈øt in louing with all our heart, but if good Ie≈øus do accept it, that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> it is perfect. The wil which wee haue to ≈øerue our Lord, is rather, ba≈ølard will, than a
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:3666:67"/>lawfull will; for to tell the troth, my brother, wee haue more skill in ≈øinning than in louing. The good theefe would not ≈øo plainely teach the euill theefe the art of loue, as hee did the duty of feare, partly becau≈øe the time was too ≈øhort to learne ≈øo high a matter, as then being in great torment, and neer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, and partly becau≈øe the quality of mans mind is ea≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly induced to feare, and very ≈ølowly to loue. O vnto how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny may wee ≈øay now adaies that which the good theefe ≈øaid vnto the other, that is, neither thou doe≈øt feare God; letting them to vnder≈øtand by the≈øe words, that they neither feare God, nor loue God, nor ≈øerue God, nor yet remember whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there bee a God, con≈øidering they let no ≈øinne vndone, vnle≈ø≈øe it bee becau≈øe they dare not, or becau≈øe they cannot. What friend is there in this world, which giueth his brother ≈øuch brotherly correction? What friend dare tell his friend, take heed brother, for thou art prowd, or ill-tongued, or a bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler, badly beloued, and euery man marketh thy doings? S. <hi>Barnard</hi> vpon tho≈øe words of <hi>Ieremy, Omnes amici eius ≈øpreue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt eum, &amp;c,</hi> ≈øayth, Woe be vnto me O my good Ie≈øus, woe be vnto me, becau≈øe that all the holy mai≈øters which brought me vp, are now dead, all my faithful friends, which were wont to giue me coun≈øell are now gone; and if I haue any left, they rather couer my faults than correct them. There are few good theeues left to correct mee, and many naughty friends to hide my faults, and (which cannot be ≈øaid without teares,) which art not content only to hide my ≈øinnes, but al≈øo are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to enti≈øe mee to ≈øinne. A certaine man of Athens asking <hi>Plato</hi> wherein he ≈øhould ≈øhew his friend≈øhip vnto him, an≈øwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him; Thou ≈øhalt adui≈øe me of all that I ≈øhall ≈øpeak ami≈ø≈øe, and helpe mee in all that I ≈øhall doe ami≈ø≈øe; becau≈øe the duty which I require of my friend is, that he would helpe mee to be vertuous, and hinder me from being vicious. There are but few friends which doe this, and very few which aske this of their friends: for there are few which will haue tho≈øe for their friends, which may and will correct them for the enormities they doe, but defend them in the vices they commit. What
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:3666:67"/>doth it auaile me if my friend deliuer mee from my enemies which lay wait for me, if he deliuer me vnto vices which kill me? We ≈øee that one theefe doth correct another from the cro≈ø≈øe, and yet one Chri≈øtian will not correct another, but will rather be vicious betwixt them≈øelues, than breake the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip which is betwixt them. <hi>Nonne qui oderunt te domine ode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram, &amp; inimici facti ≈øunt mihi?</hi> ≈øaid <hi>Dauid</hi> in the 138 P≈øalme: as if hee would ≈øay, O great God of I≈ørael, and mighty Lord of the hou≈øe of <hi>Iacob,</hi> one of the duties which I haue done for thy ≈øeruice, is, that all the daies of my life I haue hated tho≈øe which loue not thee, I haue vtterly di≈øliked tho≈øe which followed not thee, I went from them which loued not thee, yea I did flie from him which ≈øerued thee not. <hi>Ca≈øsio dorus</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the≈øe words ≈øayth, Thou ha≈øt great rea≈øon in that which thou ≈øaie≈øt, and greater in that which thou doe≈øt, O renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and gracious king <hi>Dauide</hi> for if naughty men had no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>

O what a theefe hee is (≈øayth <hi>Haymo</hi>) and a theeues fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, who can aske nothing of Chri≈øt, but honour to get him credite, power to defend him≈øelf, and might to offend others, riches to enioy, liberty to command, and health to liue onely in this world! Such as dare to aske the≈øe things of our Lord, be either Chri≈øtians without ≈øouls, or theeues without ≈øhame, of whom I doe now prophecy, that if they bee not hanged like theeues, they ≈øhall bee condemned like ≈øinners. Let vs take example by this dreadfulll example, that wee doe not aske with the naughty theefe, that our Lord would take vs from the cro≈ø≈øe, but that hee would keepe vs on the cro≈ø≈øe; nor let vs not aske of him that hee would giue vs a long life, but that he would amend our con≈øciences. For look how willing our Lord is, to giue vs things nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øaue vs, ≈øo is hee vnwilling to giue vs that which wee doe aske of him to cocker vs.</p>

There was in the ≈øame citie a widdow named <hi>Iudith,</hi> who was beautifull in her countenance, cha≈øt in her body, rich in e≈øtate, and of great fame and credite among the people. This holy <hi>Iudith</hi> perceiuing that the captains of the city were di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maied on one ≈øide, and the neighbors di≈øpaired on the other, ≈øaid vnto them as followeth: Who are you which dare tempt the great God of I≈ørael, and will giue your ≈øelues to be ≈ølaues, if he do not deliuer you from the A≈ø≈øyrians within fiue daies? Wil you pre≈øcribe fiue daies to the infinit mercy of the Lord, who hath neither beginning nor ending? Doe you not know that ≈øuch a promi≈øe and vow made again≈øt our Lord, doth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øtirre him to indignation, than appea≈øe his anger? Care not then to load your ≈øelues with armes, but with larmes: care

The warre which you endure, and the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which you ≈øuffer, the God of heauen, and not <hi>Holofernes</hi> maketh again≈øt you, and with no other weapons but with your owne offences: and you mu≈øt learne, that the enemies who be≈øiege you, are rather executioners of Gods diuine iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice, than enemies of your Commonwealth. All the time that our forefathers were at peace with our Lord, they did well; and when they neglected their duty vnto him, it went not well with them: and as it fared then with them, ≈øo doth it now with vs; in ≈øo much that all our paines and trauels come from the hands of God, either to puni≈øh vs, or for to make vs merit. Tell me (≈øaith <hi>Dauid</hi>) what are wee able to doe, what are we able to performe, or what doe wee know if we bee not guided by the hand of God? If the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> our ablene≈ø≈øe mu≈øt come from God to doe any thing, and our ≈øtrength from him to be able to performe any thing, and our knowledge from him if we will gue≈ø≈øe aright at any thing, in who≈øe hands ≈øhould wee put our hope, but in the hands of his diuine mercy? Let it bee ≈øo then, that there bee a proclamation made throughout all Bethulia, that the old men fa≈øt, the yong me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> giue them≈øelues di≈øcipline, the Prie≈øts pray, and all weepe together, that it would plea≈øe God to keepe and deliuer not the wals from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, but our hearts from ≈øinnes. All the citizens were very much amazed at that that holy <hi>Iudith</hi> coun≈øelled them, and all accepted her coun≈øell, by rea≈øon wherof, within fiue daies <hi>Holofernes</hi> was beheaded, he and his defeated, the city vnbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, and the countrey pacified. To returne then fitly vnto our purpo≈øe, agreeablie vnto this adui≈øe our theefe behaued him≈øelfe on the cro≈ø≈øe with Chri≈øt: for fir≈øt, he de≈øired our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of the world to forgiue him his ≈øinnes, before hee as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him that it would plea≈øe him to take him with him vnto the kingdome of heauen. This theef did not ≈øay vnto Chri≈øt, When thou comme≈øt into thy kingdome, Lord remember me, for ≈øo hee might haue ≈øeemed to aske for heauen before
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:3666:74"/>he had asked for the remi≈øsion of ≈øinnes; but he ≈øaid <hi>Domine memento mei,</hi> Lord remember me when thou ≈øhalt come into thy kingdome. In which words hee fir≈øt made his confe≈øsion, and then formed his petition. What doth it auaile thee to ask of Chri≈øt, if hee bee angry with thee: fir≈øt make Chri≈øt thy friend, then aske fauour at his hands. For it is the manner and condition of our Lord, that fir≈øt thou giue thy ≈øelfe vnto him, and then for him to giue him≈øelfe vnto thee. <hi>Vbertinus</hi> ≈øayth, That it is greatly to bee noted, that the good theefe did not ≈øay vnto Chri≈øt, take me from this cro≈ø≈øe, help to vnloo≈øe me, giue me life, re≈øtore my credite; but hee ≈øaid, Lord remember me, ≈øeeing that thou knowe≈øt better what to giue me, than I. to aske of thee. S. <hi>Ambro≈øe</hi> vpon S. <hi>Luke</hi> ≈øayth, That this theefe was very happy and glorious, ≈øeeing hee taught the church how to pray, as he had taught the Synagogue how to ≈øteale, con≈øidering he ≈øaid nothing in his petition, but Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member mee: the which praier although it were ≈øhort, yet it was full of my≈øtery, becau≈øe that we need not to be very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate with God to win his fauour, but remember him of our bu≈øines with <hi>Domine memento mei.</hi> What ≈øaie≈øt thou good theefe, what ≈øaie≈øt thou? <hi>Domine memento mei dum veneris in regnum tuum:</hi> as if he would ≈øay, O holy Prophet, O Ie≈øus of Galily, by the bloud which thou ≈øhedde≈øt, I be≈øeech thee, &amp; by the loue with the which thou didde≈øt ≈øhed it, I pray thee, that thou woulde≈øt be mindfull of me, when thou ≈øhalt come into thy owne proper kingdome. If wee will reckon the fiue words, they are the≈øe: <hi>Domine</hi> the fir≈øt, <hi>memento</hi> the ≈øecond, <hi>mei</hi> the third, <hi>dum veneris</hi> the fourth, <hi>in regnum tuum</hi> the fift. Now it is to be noted, who ≈øpake the≈øe words, that is a theefe, vnto whom he ≈øpake them, which was Chri≈øt, where he ≈øpake them, which was vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, and when hee ≈øpake them, and it was when hee was ready to die: in≈øomuch that if they be ea≈øie to be counted, they are hard to be vnder≈øtood. Hee dooth begin his praier like a curious Orator with this word <hi>Domine,</hi> Lord, wherein it ≈øeemeth that hee dooth confe≈ø≈øe in Chri≈øt, his Deity and diuinity, his e≈ø≈øence and power, his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:3666:75"/>and rule, his iu≈øtice and liberality. <hi>Origen</hi> ≈øayth, If the good theefe ≈øhould beleeue that Chri≈øt was a mighty and great king, yet would he aske him no le≈ø≈øe than a whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? This word Lord is a high beginning of a petition: for if he who asketh do not beleeue that all things are vnder his mighty hand, he could not thinke that he ≈øhould obtaine any thing. O glorious theefe (≈øayth <hi>An≈øelmus</hi>) and happy martyr, what doe≈øt thou ≈øee in this Lord which is crucified, what do≈øt thou ≈øee in him on the cro≈ø≈øe, why thou ≈øhoulde≈øt commend thy ≈øelfe vnto him? Who euer ≈øaw or heard the like, that one which was bound ≈øhould commend him≈øelfe vnto another, which was al≈øo bound; and one which was crucified vnto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ≈øame ca≈øe? Doe≈øt thou aske that tho≈øe confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies and friend≈øhips which end in death, ≈øhould begin with Chri≈øt and thee in death? Seeing hee who ≈øhould be a Lord, ≈øhould bee at liberty and in freedome, why doe≈øt thou call him Lord, which is fa≈øtened to the cro≈ø≈øe, and crucified like thy ≈øelfe? Seeing that he who ≈øhould be a Lord, ought to bee mighty and rich, why doe≈øt thou call him Lord, who was poor in his life time, and naked in his death? But this Prophet who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> I call vpon, and vnto whome I commend and commit my ≈øelfe, is a mighty Lord, and a king of great power, ≈øeeing the ≈øon lo≈øt his light for compa≈øsion, the ≈øtones broke with griefe, the vaile rent in ≈øunder for a my≈øtery, the graues opened with feare, and the Centurion confe≈ø≈øed him to be Chri≈øt.

Wee cannot call <hi>Hector</hi> the Troian, <hi>Anchi≈øes</hi> the Grecian, <hi>Alexander</hi> the Macedonian, and <hi>Cae≈øar</hi> the Romane, Lord, more than once, becau≈øe they were kings onely of their owne kingdomes: but
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:3666:75"/>vnto the ≈øonne of God, wee ≈øay twi≈øe <hi>Domine domine no≈øter,</hi> Lord our Lord, becau≈øe his ≈øiegnory is ≈øo great, that no man is able to limit it, nor ≈øet any bonds vnto it. Euery other Prince hath his kingdome limited and ≈øet with bonds, either to the top of a ≈øteeple or couering of a hou≈øe; and if it bee not ≈øo, let him ≈øend a po≈øt from thence vpward, and hee ≈øhall perceiue that his kingdome reacheth no higher: which cannot be ≈øaid to be true of the ≈øonne of Gods Empire, ≈øeeing it goeth from one end of the world vntill the other, and reacheth vp vnto the highe≈øt heauen. Con≈øidering that <hi>Dauid</hi> calleth Chri≈øt, Lord Lord twi≈øe, why doth he call him only once Lord. The my≈øtery of this my≈øtery is, that <hi>Dauid</hi> called him Lord, Lord twi≈øe, becau≈øe hee ≈øhould keepe his body from his enemies, and cary his ≈øoule vnto tho≈øe which are ble≈ø≈øed: but the good theefe did call him but once Lord, becau≈øe his intention was not that Chri≈øt ≈øhould keepe his life, but only that hee would vouch≈øafe to ≈øaue his ≈øoule. Why doe≈øt thou thinke (≈øayth S. <hi>Ba≈øil</hi> vpon the P≈øalme) that <hi>Dauid</hi> ≈øaid vnto our Lord, Lord calling him twife Lord, but becau≈øe he was Lord of the truth, and of the figure, of the church and of the ≈øynagogue, of the Prophets and of the Apo≈øtles, and of the old Te≈øtament and of the new? The good theefe would not call Chri≈øt Lord twi≈øe, becau≈øe hee would let vs vnder≈øtand, that the figure is fulfilled, and the truth come; that the church is come and the ≈øynagogue ended; that the Prophets are dead, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtles ≈øucceeded in their place; that the old law is buried, and the Go≈øpel proclaimed. Why, think you, doth the good theef call Chri≈øt Lord but once, but becau≈øe we haue but one Lord to beleeue, &amp; one redeemer to wor≈øhip? To ≈øay once Chri≈øt remember me, was to ≈øay, that hee would haue him and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for a ma≈øter to ≈øerue, for God in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> he would beleeue, for his Lord whom hee would obey, for a friend whome hee would tru≈øt vnto, &amp; for an aduocate in who≈øe hands he would put him≈øelfe into. The ≈øecond word which the theefe ≈øaid vnto Chri≈øt was Reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ber me: as if he would ≈øay, Seeing that I doe confe≈ø≈øe thee here before all men to bee my Lord, and

<pb n="151" facs="tcp:3666:79"/>are not reckoned, but the time from whence we are baptized. After Chri≈øts re≈øurrection, hee called his di≈øciples children and yonglings, not re≈øpecting that ≈øome of them were old, and had gray haires, but that they had not ben long baptized, that is, when hee wa≈øhed their feet in the parlar, and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them Prie≈øts after his ≈øupper. If <hi>I≈ømael</hi> did weepe at the foot of the oake in the de≈øart, ≈øo did the good theefe weepe al≈øo vpon the cro≈ø≈øe on Caluary: and that which is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent is, that if hee gaue the one water whereof hee ≈øhould drinke, he gaue the other his bloud, wherewith he ≈øhould bee ≈øaued. As <hi>Abraham</hi> had one lawfull child, which was <hi>I≈øaac,</hi> and another a ba≈øtard which was <hi>I≈ømael,</hi> ≈øo God the father had or lawfull child, which was Chri≈øt, and the other a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtard, which was the theefe; and of the≈øe two, the one was borne in the church, and the other in the Synagogue. The ble≈øsing which fell vnto <hi>I≈ømael,</hi> was that he ≈øhould be again≈øt all men and all men again≈øt him: the which ble≈øsing al≈øo the good theefe had, who being vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, and all purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing to kill and crucifie Chri≈øt, hee again≈øt all [though all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt him] defended him and excu≈øed him. <hi>I≈ømael</hi> was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of many barbarous people, and the good theefe was an example of many great ≈øinners, but not that they ≈øhould liue wickedly as hee had done, but that they ≈øhould turne vnto our Lord as hee did. <hi>Agar</hi> the mother could not ≈øee <hi>I≈ømael</hi> her ≈øonne die, neither could the ≈øonne of God ≈øee his companion the theefe bee condemned: and therefore as the teares of the one were gratefull vnto him, euen ≈øo the words of the other vvere plea≈øing vnto him; to wit, when hee ≈øaid on the cro≈ø≈øe, Lord remember me, and O good Ie≈øus haue mercy vpon mee. With great rea≈øon, and for good occa≈øion the ≈øon of God did giue care vnto all that the good theefe would ≈øpeake vnto him, and vnto all that which hee did reque≈øt of him, becau≈øe hee v≈øed ≈øuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure and di≈øcretion in his petition, that hee asked nothing which ≈øhould bee for his comfort, but for his ≈øaluation. If hee vvould haue asked any thing for his comfort, he vvould

Our Lord could not denie him ≈øo rea≈øonable a petition, nor delay him, but he an≈øwered him immediately: for euen as he ≈øaid, <hi>Domine memento moi,</hi> Chri≈øt ≈øaid pre≈øently vnto him, <hi>Hodie mecum eris in Paradi≈øo,</hi> This day thou ≈øhalt be with me in Paradi≈øe. The naughty theefe did not de≈øerue to haue an an≈øwere at Chri≈øts hands neither ≈øoon nor late, partly becau≈øe it was the ≈øonne of Gods cu≈øtome, not to an≈øwer tho≈øe which did iniury him, nor e≈øteeme of tho≈øe which bare fal≈øe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe again≈øt him, and partly to adui≈øe vs, that it is a point of great di≈øcretion, not to ≈øet by iniurious words. <hi>Vbertinus</hi> ≈øaith, Why ≈øhould Chri≈øt heare what the naughty theefe would aske him, or make account of it, ≈øeeing that he knew very wel that if he would haue beene loo≈øed, it was to ≈øteale againe, and in ≈øtealing againe, they would hang him againe? In that that Chri≈øt would not an≈øwere vnto the naughty theefe, nor yeeld vnto his petition, hee v≈øed a new kind of clemency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him; to wit, that he hindered him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> ≈øinning any more, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> augmenting his damnation: for if Chri≈øt ≈øhould haue taken him from the cro≈ø≈øe, and hee haue returned againe into the world, by how much the more he would haue augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ted his ≈øinne, by ≈øo much the more he ≈øhould haue encrea≈øed his puni≈øhment. S. <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ≈øayth, That our Lord ≈øhewed his mercy and pity toward both the theeues; vnto the good one in giuing him glory, to the naughty one in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying him life: for if he had liued longer, he would haue ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned more, and according to the mea≈øure of his offences, his torments ≈øhould haue beene giuen him. S. <hi>Gregory</hi> ≈øaith, That if our Lord doe for vs that which wee aske, wee ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioice; and if he deny vs that which wee aske him, wee mu≈øt not complaine: for if our Lord would haue giuen the ≈øonnes

If Chri≈øt did ≈øwear it was not becau≈øe there was any want in his word, but becau≈øe the ≈øynagogue ≈øhould the better beleeue him. <hi>Augu≈øt.</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ≈øaith, That if the ≈øon of God would not haue ≈øworn the performance of ≈øo great a gift, it would haue ≈øeemed vnto the Iewes, that he had promi≈øed it him in a mockage; &amp; ≈øo much the rather, becau≈øe that vntil that very in≈øta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t, in which Chri≈øt ≈øaid on the cro≈ø≈øe, <hi>Hodie mecum eris in Paradi≈øe,</hi> he neuer gaue it vnto Saint, nor promi≈øed it in ≈øcripture. If Chri≈øt had not ≈øworn that which he promi≈øed, who would not haue thought that he had ie≈øted in promi≈øing credit &amp; honor vnto him who had lo≈øt his credit, to promi≈øe life vnto him who was dead, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty vnto him who was bound, riches vnto him who was poore, and glory vnto him who was infamous? Becau≈øe the Iewes ob≈øtinacy was ≈øo great, and the good theeues faith but yong and weake, good Ie≈øus would ≈øweare before hee promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed that which he meant to promi≈øe; &amp; becau≈øe al men might be certain, that he who at the point of death, confirmed any thing by oth, ought neuer to deceiue.</p>

As God is iu≈øt (≈øaith <hi>Ierome</hi>) hee ≈øayth nothing but that which is iu≈øt, and as he is holy, he ≈øpeaketh nothing but holy things; becau≈øe other men be≈øides him, neither tell vs aright what wee haue to doe, nor adui≈øe vs in time of that which we are to auoid. All out friends and coun≈øellors, when they doe aduerti≈øe vs of any thing, doe ≈øeeme rather to goe by gue≈ø≈øe, than bee ≈øure of that which they ≈øay: and by that means they giue vs coun≈øell after we haue receiued hurt, and teach vs the way after that wee haue gone a≈øtray. God ≈øayth very well, that <hi>Iacob</hi> heard him not in vaine, neither did I≈ørael that in vaine which he commanded him, ≈øeeing that he gaue him the right of the fir≈øt birth, due to <hi>E≈øau,</hi> and made him ≈øonne in law vnto <hi>Laban,</hi> and gaue him <hi>Lia</hi> and <hi>Rachel</hi> for his wiues, and made him father of twelue children, and Prince ouer twelue tribes. O how true it is (≈øaith <hi>Origen</hi>) when our
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:3666:83"/>Lord ≈øaith that hee ≈øpeaketh nothing but that which is iu≈øt, and teacheth nothing but that which is right, ≈øeeing hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth tho≈øe iu≈øt who deale with him, and maketh tho≈øe holy who doe conuer≈øe with him. And if he ≈øay that the ob≈øtinate men and naughty be his, yet he will not ≈øay, that hee is one of their number. What can the children of vanity tell vs but vain things, and what can the children of lies tell vs but lies? Who is loiall and faithfull vnto him whome hee hareth, or whom commodity draweth awry? It is our Lord onely who giueth vs our ≈øight to ≈øee with, and teacheth vs which way we ≈øhould goe, and taketh away the ≈øtones lea≈øt wee ≈øtumble at them, and giueth vs coun≈øell in all that wee haue to doe. Our Lord ≈øaith very well, that hee is the Lord who ≈øpeaketh iu≈øtice and righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe: for there hath been no man ≈øaued vntill this day, whom he hath not coun≈øelled, nor no man lo≈øt whome hee hath not deceiued. King <hi>Roboam</hi> who was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> and ≈øonne vnto <hi>Salomon,</hi> of twelue king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes which hee inherited from his predece≈ø≈øors, lo≈øt ten of them, for no other rea≈øon, but becau≈øe hee beleeved not our Lord in that which hee coun≈øelled him, and by following o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther young mens humors, which plea≈øed his fancy. <hi>Ieroboam</hi> and <hi>A≈ø≈øa,</hi> and <hi>Iozias,</hi> and <hi>Achab,</hi> and <hi>Benedab,</hi> and <hi>Mana≈ø≈øes,</hi> which were famous kings of I≈ørael, what could they do to get credit, what could they doe again≈øt their enemies, or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in could they helpe their friends, or how could they deale in their owne affaires, becau≈øe they beleeued not in God, nor followed his coun≈øels? And therefore ≈øeeing hee ≈øayth, I am the Lord who ≈øpeaketh iu≈øtice, whom ≈øhould we giue ear vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to but vnto him, who≈øe doing ≈øhould wee credite but his, and e≈øpecially, ≈øeeing that be alone &amp; no other, ≈øeeth that which is pre≈øent, and knoweth all that is pa≈øt, vnder≈øtandeth that which is doubtfull, teacheth vnto that that is ≈øecret, knoweth things to come, and withall mo≈øt of all others de≈øireth that which is good for vs?

S. <hi>Barnard</hi> in an Epi≈øtle ≈øayth, That it is not without cau≈øe that God ≈øaid by <hi>E≈øay,</hi> I am the Lord which ≈øpeaketh iu≈øtice and righteou≈øne≈ø≈øe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe that the coun≈øels which me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> giue vs, are but coniectures and no certainties, but the coun≈øels which God giueth vs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not faile but be as he hath ordained. God ≈øaid vnto <hi>Iacob, non fru≈øtr√† dixi, quaerite me,</hi> that is, That he had not giuen him that coun≈øell in vaine, neither did it repent <hi>Iacob</hi> at any time to haue followed it: but few men can ≈øay this, nor few coun≈øels can bee prai≈øed in this ≈øort: for oftentimes it were better giue a coun≈øellor his fee, not to follow his coun≈øell, than to follow it. He giueth me coun≈øell in vain, who maketh me more pa≈øsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate than already I am, and maketh me enter into more ≈øutes than I haue already begun, becau≈øe it is the dutie of a good friend to put him in his vvay vvho is out of it, lift him vp who is downe, comfort him vvho is afflicted, and quiet his mind vvho is mooued vvith pa≈øsions. Vpon tho≈øe vvordes of the P≈øalme, <hi>Audiam quid loquetur in me dominus deus, Ba≈øil</hi> the great ≈øaith, O how vvillingly I vvill heare all that thou vvilt ≈øay vnto me O good Ie≈øus, becau≈øe thou art eloquent in ≈øpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, vvi≈øe in coun≈øelling, pittifull in pardoning, iu≈øt in ≈øuccou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, mighty in commanding, bountifull in giuing, and true in accompli≈øhing all that thou doe≈øt promi≈øe. What did euer good man aske of thee, but thou ha≈øt commanded it to bee giuen him, and what ha≈øt thou commanded but hee hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained? What can a man giue but that which hee hath, and what can a man ≈øay, but that which he knoweth? <hi>Seneca</hi> vnto this purpo≈øe ≈øayth, That if we find a man eloquent in ≈øpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, vve ≈øhal find him weake in vvit, to put that in execution vvhich he ≈øpeaketh; in≈øomuch that if it be a plea≈øure to hear him, it is daugerous to beleeue him.

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:3666:84"/>hard in forgiuing his owne enemy; in≈øomuch that if he be iu≈øt in other mens iniuries, he is very vindicatiue of his owne. It is the property of a man, that if he haue much temporall goods at his commandement, he hath no vvill to ≈øpend them vvith any; ≈øo that if by the reque≈øt of friends, or importunitie of neighbours, he do part vvith any thing, he doth vveep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doth leaue it. It is the property of man, although not of a wi≈øe man, to de≈øire to be heard, although he cannot ≈øpeak, to be feared although he haue no authority, and wel beloued although he cannot loue, and be beleeued although he ≈øpeak not true, and he vvill bee ≈øerued although hee haue no need. What tongue can ≈øpeake it, and vvhat heart can ≈øuffer and endure to talke vvith a foole, to loue an vngratefull man, to aske and craue of a niggard, deale vvith a liar, and ≈øerue a proud man? Hee vvho forgetteth God, and dealeth vvith man, cumbereth him≈øelfe vvith all the≈øe inconueniences, and bindeth him≈øelfe vnto all the≈øe obligations, and the rather becau≈øe there is no man vvho tru≈øteth long another man, but in the end is paied for it. To come then vnto our purpo≈øe, the good theefe was mo≈øt happy in vvor≈øhipping Chri≈øt alone, and beleeuing in him onely: for reward vvhereof Chri≈øt ≈øaid vnto him alone and no other, This day thou ≈øhalt be with me in Paradi≈øe. It is a great pitty to ≈øee how many Leuites and Prie≈øts, Lawyers and ancients, neighbours, and acquaintance of Chri≈øt vvere about the cro≈ø≈øe, looking how he ≈øuffered, &amp; vvatching how he died; vnto none of all vvhich he ≈øaid, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die me cum eris in Paradi≈øo,</hi> as he did vnto the good theefe; in ≈øo much that they heard the words, but vvanted the promi≈øe. Seeing our good Ie≈øus (≈øaith <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtome</hi>) vvas determined to giue the good theefe glory, vvhy did hee not giue it him, and hold his peace? And ≈øeeing hee did not ≈øend him vvord by a third per≈øon, vvhy did he not tell it him in ≈øecret, and in his eare? And ≈øeeing he vvould not tell him in ≈øecret, but pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, why did he not defer the reward? And yet if he would not defer the reward, vvhy did he not ≈øend him to heauen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but vvould take him to Paradi≈øe vvith him≈øelfe? All
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:3666:84"/>the≈øe are ≈øuch high my≈øteries and ≈øuch deepe ≈øecrets, that there is no wit able to vnder≈øtand them, nor tongue able to ≈øet them forth, nor hand able to write them, and therefore it is nece≈ø≈øary for vs to craue for the grace of our Lord to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect vs in it, and the holy Gho≈øt to lighten vs. When Chri≈øt ≈øaid vnto the theefe, This day thou ≈øhalt bee with mee in Paradi≈øe, it is as if hee had ≈øaid: O thou theefe my friend and fellow, ≈øeeing that I know with whome I ≈øpeake, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo rea≈øon, that thou doe know who ≈øpeaketh: and therefore I let thee vnder≈øtand, that I am the creator of heauen, I am the redeemer of the world, I am the Prophet which is de≈øired, I am the Me≈øsias promi≈øed, I am the giuer of the Go≈øpell, and I am al≈øo the Lord of Paradi≈øe. Let all men beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe with me, &amp; therefore I ≈øpeake it openly, that I bequeath my eternall Paradi≈øe vnto this theefe by this Will and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtament, becau≈øe that all ≈øuch which ≈øhall ≈øucceed me in my church, may know how well I recompence tho≈øe which ≈øerue me, and how well I deale with tho≈øe which follow mee. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelmus</hi> crieth out and ≈øaith, O glorious theefe, O happy theef, how fortunate and lucky wa≈øt thou, ≈øeeing thou didde≈øt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that which did content our good Ie≈øus, nor ≈øaide≈øt nothing but that which well liked him! Thy feet with the which thou didde≈øt follow him were happy, the eies with the which thou did≈øt ≈øuffer with him was happy, the tongue with the which thou didde≈øt confe≈ø≈øe him was happy, &amp; the heart with the which thou didde≈øt beleeue in him was happy.

The emba≈øie which <hi>Iohn Bapti≈øt</hi> brought vs, was that the kingdome of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> was at hand, but the good theef ≈øaith not that he is neer vnto heauen, but that he is within heauen, S. <hi>Iohns</hi> was a great emba≈øie, when he ≈øaid, Behold the lambe of God which taketh away the ≈øinnes of the world: but that of the theeues was better whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> he ≈øaid, Behold him here who hath already redeemed the world. The emba≈øie that <hi>Samuel</hi> brought vnto <hi>Dauid</hi> was good, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> as of a ≈øhepheard he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed him king but the emba≈øie which Chri≈øt did vnto the good theef was farre better, becau≈øe that there pa≈ø≈øed almo≈øt fourty years betwixt the time that the kingdome was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> and the time that it was deliuered vnto him, but the theef had his kingdome promi≈øed him at two of the clock in the afternoone, and was giuen him pre≈øently toward night. The reward for bringing thee news of ≈øuch a great em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba≈øie as that of Chri≈øts was, that is, the promi≈øe of glory, he would let no man haue but he would win it him≈øelf; in≈øomuch he who promi≈øed glory &amp; gaue glory, was the glory it ≈øelf. O good Ie≈øus, redeemer of my ≈øoule, &amp; do≈øt thou well ≈øee that in promi≈øing glory &amp; Paradi≈øe that thou doe≈øt promi≈øe nothing but thy ≈øelf? what meaneth this O good Ie≈øus, what meaneth this?

Our Lord doth threaten the wicked whome hee meaneth to puni≈øh, with two grieuous ≈øcourges, that is, that hee will ≈øpeake in anger to feare them, and trouble their iudgement that they ≈øhall not bee able to gue≈ø≈øe at any thing aright. If our Lord ≈øpeake vnto vs with anger, it may bee borne with, but if he trouble our iudgement, it is a thing much to be lamented: for in this wicked world, if he doe not lighten our ≈øteps to ≈øee where wee goe, wee ≈øhall fall downe vpon our face. <hi>Barnard</hi> crieth out and ≈øaith: What ≈øhall become of thee, O my ≈øoule, if he who ≈øhould lead me put mee out of the way, if hee who ≈øhould ≈øuccour me for≈øake mee, if hee who ≈øhould pardon me accu≈øe me, and he who ≈øhould quit mee condemne me, and he who ≈øhould giue mee ≈øight make mee blind? Saint <hi>Augu≈øtine De verbis Apostoli</hi> ≈øayth, When it is ≈øaid in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that God ≈øpeaketh vnto vs with anger, it is meant that he doth not ≈øpeake with mercy, and when it is ≈øaid that hee doth trouble vs with fury, it is to ≈øay that hee doth not lighten vs with his diuine grace, becau≈øe there cannot happen vnto vs greater hurt in this world, than for God to withdraw his hand from doing vs good. There is no anger in God, as there is in
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:3666:87"/>man, with the which hee doth trouble him≈øelfe, nor furie to moue him withall; and when wee ≈øay that he is angry, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he v≈øeth that puni≈øhment which in others is done with anger, and if we ≈øay that he is in fury, it is becau≈øe hee v≈øeth ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous puni≈øhment towards vs, or el≈øe becau≈øe hee doth not puni≈øh at all in this world: for wherin can our Lord ≈øhew grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter anger, than by not v≈øing his accu≈øtomed clemency? Our Lords wrath is appea≈øed when hee puni≈øheth pre≈øently after the offence committed, and he is very angry when hee defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the puni≈øhment vnto hell. S. <hi>Ambro≈øe</hi> ≈øayth, That in the hou≈øe of God, not to puni≈øh is to puni≈øh, to di≈ø≈øemble is to bee angry with, not to ≈øpeake is to chide, to pardon is to threaten, to ≈øuffer is to let it putrifie, &amp; to defer is to reuenge the more. Is there, thinke you, any greater puni≈øhment, than not to bee puni≈øhed in this world? When doth our Lord ≈øpeake vnto vs with anger, but when wee fall from his grace into ≈øinne by our fault? God ≈øpake with anger vnto our fir≈øt father, when hee ≈øaid vnto him thou ≈øhalt eat thy bread in the ≈øweat of thy face, as if hee would ≈øay, Becau≈øe thou ha≈øt fallen from my grace, and eaten of the apple which I did forbid thee to eat of, for a perpetuall puni≈øhment, thou ≈øhalt eat and drinke alwaies with care in thy mind, ≈øweat on thy face, and trauaile of thy body, in≈øomuch that at the be≈øt mor≈øell thou ≈øhalt giue ouer eating, and fall to ≈øighing. God ≈øpake al≈øo with anger vnto the murderer <hi>Cain,</hi> when hee ≈øaid vnto him, behold the bloud of thy brother <hi>Abel</hi> doth crie from the earth vnto mee: as if he would ≈øay Becau≈øe thou ha≈øt flaine thy brother <hi>Abel</hi> through malice and enuy, I cannot but doe iu≈øtice vpon thee, becau≈øe his bloud crieth aloud for it of me; and thy puni≈øhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t ≈øhall be, that thou ≈øhalt wander to and fro all the daies of thy life, and thy head ≈øhal neuer cea≈øe ≈øhaking.

God ≈øpake with anger vnto the great Prie≈øt <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi> when hee ≈øaid, <hi>Ego praecidam brachium tuum, &amp;c,</hi> as if hee would ≈øay, Becau≈øe thou didde≈øt not puni≈øh thy children when they ≈øtole away the ≈øacrifices, and behaued them≈øelues di≈øhone≈øtly vvith women in the Tabernacle, I will take thy Prie≈øthood from thee, I will kill thy ≈øteward, and will make that no old man come into thy hou≈øe, in ≈øo much that thou ≈øhalt haue no children in thy ≈øtocke to inherite after thee, nor ancient men to coun≈øell thee. To come then vnto our purpo≈øe, God v≈øed this kind of ≈øpeech vnto the Synagogue, but now ≈øpeaketh otherwi≈øe vnto the church, as is ea≈øily ≈øeene in the death of Chri≈øt, when hee ≈øaid vnto the theefe, <hi>Hodie mecum eris in Paradi≈øe.</hi> Wee doe not read that Chri≈øt did euer v≈øe this woord of anger ≈øo oft as hee hath done the woord of mercy, the which hee hath v≈øed often, as <hi>Per vi≈øcera mi≈øericor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diae dei nostra,</hi> ≈øaid holy <hi>Zachary</hi> in his ≈øong: as if he would ≈øay, The ≈øonne of God came downe from the highe≈øt of heauen into the earth, moued thereunto by the bowels of his mercy. The holy Prophet dooth in this open a high my≈øtery vnto vs, whereby hee giueth vs to vnder≈øtand, how entirely our Lord dooth loue vs, ≈øeeing that hee doth vi≈øite vs vvith the bowels of his mercy. There bee many vvhich haue this word Mercy in their mouth, but not in their hands, and tho≈øe bee ≈øuch as are faire in ≈øpeech, but cruell in deedes, and ≈øuch v≈øe ≈øweet ≈øpeech to take men, and flattery to kill them. Others there bee which haue mercy in their handes, and nor in their tongues, the which are rough in words, but mild and gentle in deeds, and tho≈øe offer blowes but ≈øtrike not, they feare but kill not. Only our ≈øweet Ie≈øus hath mercy &amp; pity in his mouth, ≈øeeing hee dooth ≈øo much commend it vnto vs, and in his deedes ≈øeeing hee dooth v≈øe it ≈øo much, and al≈øo in his bowels becau≈øe hee dooth loue vs ≈øo much. S. <hi>Barnard</hi> ≈øayth vnto this purpo≈øe, Our Lord would not place mercy in the eies, lea≈øt they ≈øhould make him blind, hee would not place it in the eares, for feare they ≈øhould make him deaffe, hee would not
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:3666:88"/>place it in the handes, for feare it ≈øhould bee lo≈øt, hee would not put it to keepe in the body for feare lea≈øt it ≈øhould grow old, neither yet in the tongue for feare hee ≈øhould be dumbe: But our good Ie≈øus put it to keepe in his heart to be≈øtow it vpon tho≈øe whom hee loueth, and keepeth it within his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, becau≈øe that all that which is loued with the heart is kept within the heart. O good Ie≈øus, O the life of my ≈øoule, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeech thee by the bowels of thy mercy, that thou woulde≈øt take pity on my ≈øinfull ≈øoule, and ≈øeeing I haue no other Lord in my bowels but thy ≈øelfe, on whom woulde≈øt thou bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be≈øtow the mercy which thou ha≈øt within thine, than vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mee! Thou didde≈øt ≈øpeake with the bowels of thy mercy, vnto the good theefe, when thou wa≈øt not content onely to ≈øay: <hi>Amen,</hi> Truly I ≈øay, but thou didde≈øt adde <hi>tibi</hi> to thee, letting vs vnder≈øtand, that thou didde≈øt ≈øpeake vnto him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and promi≈øe Paradi≈øe vnto him alone and vnto no other. <hi>Vbertinus</hi> ≈øayth, That if when Chri≈øt ≈øaid <hi>Amen dico,</hi> hee had not added <hi>tibi,</hi> his mother who brought forth his humanity, and the other theefe which had lo≈øt his liberty, might haue thought that hee had ≈øpoken vnto them, I ≈øay if hee had not turned him≈øelfe vnto the good theefe, and ≈øaid <hi>tibi.</hi> What meaneth this O good Ie≈øus, what meaneth this, doe≈øt thou ≈øpeake vnto the theefe, and forget thy mother? Doe≈øt thou not ≈øpeake vnto thy mother who bare thee nine months in her bowels, and doe≈øt thou ≈øpeake vnto the theefe who had knowne thee but three houres? Doe≈øt thou promi≈øe pre≈øently Paradi≈øe vnto the theefe which ≈øpake but three words, and doe≈øt thou make no reckoning of thy mother, who bought thee with her teares? Doe≈øt thou be≈øtow thy preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bloud, fir≈øt vpon a theefe which knew not how to do any thing el≈øe but ≈øhed bloud by the high waies, before thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt be≈øtow it vpon thy mother? Would it not bee rea≈øon to pay thy mother now with the bloud that runneth from thy ≈øide, for the milke which thou didde≈øt ≈øucke of her brea≈øt? What more heroicall and diuine exchange could there bee made in the world betwixt the ≈øonne and the mother, the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:3666:89"/>mother and the ≈øonne than bloud for milke, and milke for bloud? If thou doe≈øt looke O good Ie≈øus that ≈øhee ≈øhould ≈øpeake vnto thee as the theefe did, doe≈øt thou not ≈øee that for wearines ≈øhe cannot helpe thee, for griefe ≈øhe cannot looke vpon thee, for feare ≈øhee cannot comfort thee, and for being a≈øtonied ≈øhee cannot ≈øpeake vnto thee? I be≈øeech thee <hi>Per vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcera mi≈øericordia,</hi> that thou woulde≈øt ≈øay, <hi>Amen dico vobis,</hi> as thou doe≈øt ≈øay, <hi>Amen dico tibi:</hi> For by that means thou ≈øhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de≈øt comfort thy mother, ≈øatisfie the theefe, vanqui≈øhe Hell, helpe the world, and withall I ≈øhould haue hope to be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. If thou doe≈øt die for all and not for one, why doe≈øt thou not ≈øay, Verely I ≈øay vnto you, as thou doe≈øt ≈øay, Truly I ≈øay vnto thee? O ≈øweet Ie≈øus, and loue of my ≈øoule, ≈øeeing that vpon my knees, and my face bathed in teares, I ≈øay vnto thee, <hi>Tibi ≈øoli peccaui,</hi> I haue ≈øinned vnto thee alone, doe not I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerue to heare from thy mouth the≈øe words, <hi>Amen dico tibi,</hi> Truly I ≈øay vnto thee? <hi>An≈øelmus</hi> ≈øayth, That it was too time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to giue Paradi≈øe vnto his mother, and the other theefe had not de≈øerued it, and the great Centurion was not yet become a Chri≈øtian, and the Iewes were hardened in their hearts, and therefore it was not without cau≈øe that he ≈øaid vnto the theef, <hi>Amen dico tibi,</hi> and not <hi>Amen dico vobis.</hi> It was a great word which God ≈øpake vnto the fir≈øt man, that is, <hi>dominamini pi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibus maris, &amp; volatilibus cali:</hi> but that which hee ≈øpake vnto the good theefe was farre greater, becau≈øe it is far better to be companions vnto the Angels in heauen, than kings ouer bea≈øts vpon earth. It was a great word that God ≈øpake vnto <hi>Noe,</hi> that is, I found thee iu≈øt in my ≈øight: but this which hee ≈øpake vnto the theefe was far greater, becau≈øe it is better to be iu≈øt &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the reward of being iu≈øt, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> to be ≈øimply iu≈øt. That was a fauourable ≈øpeech which hee v≈øed vnto king <hi>Dauid,</hi> I haue found a man according vnto my heart: but this which he ≈øpake vnto the good theefe was farre more fauourable, becau≈øe that <hi>Dauid</hi> was but neere vnto his heart, but the theefe was in his heart. And it did appear ea≈øily, that <hi>Dauid</hi> was but neer Gods heart, ≈øeeing hee did ≈øinne afterward, and it doth well appeare
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:3666:89"/>that hee had the theefe within his heart, ≈øeeing hee ≈øuffered him to ≈øinne nor ≈øteale no more. That was a fauorable ≈øpeech which God v≈øed vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is, <hi>Num celare potero qua ge≈øturus ≈øum Abraham.</hi> But that which was v≈øed towards the theefe was more fauourable, becau≈øe the greate≈øt ≈øecret that God reuealed vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> was, that the ≈øon of God ≈øhould come into the world, but hee did not onely reueale, but al≈øo ≈øhew this vnto the good theef. Chri≈øt did tru≈øt the good theef better tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> he did tru≈øt <hi>Abraham,</hi> becau≈øe he was the fir≈øt ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner who ≈øaw the redemption of the world with his eies, &amp; he was hee vpon whome the bloud of Chri≈øt was fir≈øt be≈øtowed. The precious bloud of the ≈øonne of God was then otherwi≈øe ≈øhed towards the theefe, who was vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, than to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his mother who was by the cro≈ø≈øe; becau≈øe it dropped downe vpon the garment of his ≈øorrowfull mother, but it went to the ≈øoule of the theefe to ≈øaue him, &amp; therevpon the holy theef went immediately to Paradi≈øe, but his ≈øorrowful mother ≈øtaied weeping on the Mount of Caluary. O holy bloud, O heauenly blame, why doe≈øt thou take ≈øuch pity on the theefe, &amp; doe≈øt deferre to giue thy mother the kingdome of heauen which thou doe≈øt giue pre≈øently vnto the theefe? Doe≈øt thou defer it to her who brought forth Chri≈øt, &amp; take pity on him who bare him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>pany on the cro≈ø≈øe, ≈øeeing thou doe≈øt augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t tears in her, &amp; dimini≈øh offences in him? It was a word of great fauor which hee did v≈øe vnto <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> that <hi>Remi≈øsa ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi peccata multa,</hi> Many ≈øins are forgiuen thee: but yet that was greater which he did v≈øe to the good theefe, becau≈øe hee v≈øed greater liberty with him tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> with hir: for if he loued her &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned her, he loued the theef like a friend, pardoned him like a Chri≈øtian, &amp; rewarded him lika a iu≈øt man. <hi>Barnard</hi> ≈øaith vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this purpo≈øe, That it is a ≈øigne of great loue to pardon, but a greater ≈øign to giue &amp; pardon; becau≈øe that pardon is ≈øometime giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> by force, but a gift neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>meth but of free wil. <hi>Orige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>

               <p>S. <hi>Ambro≈øe</hi> ≈øayth, That Chri≈øt receiued in a new kind of martyrdome all the torments vvhich were giuen the theefe as a naughty man from the houre and moment that he defended Chri≈øt, and confe≈ø≈øed with Chri≈øt: in≈øomuch that if he began to ≈øuffer like a theefe and a rouer, hee ended and died like a glorious martyr.

S. <hi>Augustine</hi> ≈øayth, O good Ie≈øus, O my ≈øoules delight, con≈øidering that thou doe≈øt ≈øaue him who accu≈øeth his owne faults, and him who excu≈øeth thy innocency, the maintainer of thy credit, the confe≈ø≈øor of thy e≈ø≈øence, the companion of thy per≈øon, wilt thou not ≈øaue al≈øo this ≈øinfull ≈øoule of mine? For ≈øo great a battaile as thou ha≈øt won this day, for ≈øo great a victory as thou ha≈øt obtained, and al≈øo for ≈øo much bloud as hath i≈ø≈øued from thee, it is a ≈ømall prize to carry away with thee but one theef only, becau≈øe that by ≈øo much the greater the triumph is, by how many more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoners the triumpher is followed with all.

For if <hi>Dauid</hi> could haue found any greater loue, vnto a greater hee would haue compared his.

God had no better experience to proue the loue which the Patriarch <hi>Abraham</hi> bare him, but to command him to kill his onely ≈øonne, which hee had in his hou≈øe, and when the old man had lifted vp his ≈øword to ≈ølay the young youth, the Angell tooke him by the arme, and commanded him to be quiet: for now our Lord was ≈øatisfied, to ≈øee that he loued him better than his own ≈øon. When news was brought to holy <hi>Iob,</hi> how the wi≈øe men had robbed him of fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yoke of oxen, and that a fla≈øh of lightning from heauen had burnt him ≈øeuen thou≈øand ≈øheepe, and that the Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had taken from him three thou≈øand Camels, and had put to the ≈øword all the ≈øhepheards of his flocke, the good man was not grieued at all with it, nor vttered any ≈øorrowfull word forir.

What is it to ≈øay, that hee loued him tenderly, but that the father loued him with mo≈øt entire loue, in≈øomuch that he denied him nothing which he had, nor hid nothing from him of that hee did know? Let vs leaue off the loue of the Father, and let vs ≈øpeake ≈øomewhat of the loue of the mother, who loued her precious ≈øonne with a tender heart, and wept for him with tender bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els.

Loue which is deuided into ≈øo many parts, cannot po≈øsibly bee equall with that loue which the Virgine bare her ≈øonne. Loue that is pure and not fained, cannot bee ≈øpread abroad, but gathered in one, not in many but in one, not deuided but entire, not ≈øtroken but hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vp, not for a time but for euer, not finding excu≈øes or faults but ≈øuffering, not ≈øu≈øpitious but confident and tru≈øting.

<pb n="192" facs="tcp:3666:100"/>and a helpe for many to ri≈øe by againe, and hee ≈øhall bee as it were the white in a butt, which very many ≈øhall ≈øhoot at, but few at all hit. <hi>Dauid</hi> in his P≈øalme ≈øpake of Chri≈øt, that which vvas not vnlike vnto that that <hi>Simeon</hi> ≈øpake of Chri≈øt; that is, <hi>Cadent in retitulo eius omnes peceatores,</hi> as if hee would ≈øay, All the ≈øinners of the vvorld ≈øhal fall into his nets, my ≈øelfe excepted who am ≈øaued by ≈øpecial priuiledge. And it is much to bee noted, that the Prophet doth not ≈øay, that there is not any one con≈øtrained to fall into the net, but they will fall into it of their owne voluntary vvill, and entangle them≈øelues; and ≈øo vve may ≈øay that there is no fault of the mai≈øters net, if he making and arming his net to take fi≈øh, yet men will fall, into it. Neither did <hi>Simeon</hi> ≈øay, when he ≈øpake of Chri≈øt, that hee ≈øhould be the fall of many; but hee ≈øaid, <hi>Po≈øitus e≈øt in ruinam,</hi> Becau≈øe there is very great difference if I make you fall, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you vvould not fall, or to fall or ≈øtumble on me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my making you fall. <hi>Remigius</hi> vpon S. <hi>Luke</hi> ≈øaith, That notwith≈øtanding that <hi>Dauid</hi> doth ≈øay that all ≈øinners ≈øhal fall into his net, and that <hi>Simeon</hi> doth ≈øay that hee is put a ≈øtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocke, I ≈øay that notwith≈øtanding all this, wee ≈øhould beare fal≈øe witne≈ø≈øe again≈øt the ≈øonne of God, if wee ≈øhould ≈øay that hee hath beene the cau≈øe that any man hath fallen from the faith: for it cannot be ≈øpoken of the ≈øelfe ≈øame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, that he is come to redeeme vs, and that hee is the cau≈øe of our damnation. If I make a bridge ouer the which all men may goe ouer a ≈øtrong and a dangerous riuer, what fault am I in, if you ca≈øt your ≈øelfe downe from it into the riuer, ≈øeeing that I made it to the end that you might goe ouer ≈øafely, and you would needes throw your ≈øelues headlong into the vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? When the ≈øunne doth ca≈øt his morning beames ouer all the world, what fault is he in, if through his heat and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe the durt be hardened, and waxe made ≈øoft? If there be a ≈øtone put to pa≈ø≈øe ouer a quagmire or durtie place, and you fall and beray your ≈øelfe, what fault is the ≈øtone in, ≈øeeing that you could not ≈øtand vpon it? The ≈øonne of God was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing el≈øe in this world, but a bridge for vs to pa≈ø≈øe ouer, and a
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:3666:100"/>≈øunne with the which wee ≈øhould haue lightened our ≈øelues, and a ≈øtone vpon which we ≈øhould tread on, and a ≈øword vvith the which we ≈øhould haue defended our ≈øelues: and ≈øhall hee then be in any fault, if wee turne that into poy≈øon, which hee gaue vs for triacle? <hi>Ca≈øsiodorus</hi> vpon the P≈øalme ≈øaith, That all the ≈øinners of the earth ≈øhall fall into his net without any fault at al in the ≈øon of God: for ≈øeeing he came into the world, preached vnto the world, amended the world, taught the world, and redeemed the world, what fault is there in him, if a man damne him≈øelfe, con≈øidering that hee will not keepe the law which is giuen him by God? Chri≈øts holy law is not an occa≈øion for vs to fall, nor ≈øu≈øpicious to be beleeued in, nor ob≈øcure to bee vnder≈øtood, nor hard to bee kept, in ≈øo much that the danger is not in that which he commandeth vs, but in that that we doe di≈øobey his commandement. Then when old <hi>Simeon</hi> doth ≈øay of Ie≈øus the child, that hee is put for a ≈øtumbling blocke vnto many, he wil not ≈øay that the ≈øonne of God ≈øhould be a cau≈øe that many ≈øhould be ca≈øt away in his church, but that many would fal from his holy law, and e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially more perfideous Iewes than of others, who when they ≈øhould haue been blowers abroad of his holy doctrine, were hangmen of his holy life. Saint <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> ≈øayth, That all Gentiles haue fallen into his net vvhich know him not, all Iewes by not receauing him, all Tyrants by per≈øecuting his Martyrs, all Heretikes by fal≈øifieng ≈øcriptures, and all naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men fall daily by bla≈øpheming his name. Of the ≈øame flowr that the Bee gathereth honny, the ≈øpider maketh poy≈øon: rattes bane to poy≈øon vvith, and triacle to help men vvith, is made of the ≈øame thing: the ro≈øe which ≈ømelleth ≈øweet, &amp; the adder which biteth deadly, is often bred in the ≈øame bu≈øh, &amp; of the ≈øame wood men do oft cut timber to couer a church, &amp; to make a gibbet. Good iudgements by the≈øe examples may ea≈øily perceiue that which I haue ≈øaid to bee true vvithout further triall. What fault may bee imputed vnto the ≈øonne of God if of the ≈øame holy law the Iew gather poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, and the Chri≈øtian honny; the infidell gathereth

It is al≈øo to bee noted, that ≈øinners will fall not into a net, but they will fall into <hi>reticulo</hi> a ≈ømall net: for if we wil wel looke vnto it, Chri≈øt hath put before vs more rea≈øons to ≈øaue our ≈øelues, than the Deuill hath ≈øet occa≈øions before vs to damne vs. They are but ≈ømall nets which the deuill doth ≈øet before vs to fall into, but they are very great and large nets, which God putteth to catch vs; but yet alas if there fall tenne into Chri≈øts net, there fall tenne thou≈øand into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils ≈ømall net. <hi>Cyrillus</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ≈øayth, That according vnto the prophecy of <hi>Simeon</hi> and of <hi>Daniell,</hi> the ≈øonne of God came for the fall of the Babilonians, Egyptians, Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans, Per≈øians and Medes, Greekes and tho≈øe of Pale≈øtine, becau≈øe the law of the Go≈øpell hath been preached and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in tho≈øe places. <hi>Chry≈øostom</hi> ≈øaith, That the ≈øon of God came to take fle≈øh for the fall of the Temple of <hi>Salomon,</hi> the city of Ieru≈øalem, the ≈øacrifices of Iuda, the ceremonies of I≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell, and of the old Mo≈øaicall law, and of the pride of all the Synagogue, which was all ended and gaue vp the gho≈øt with this word, <hi>Con≈øummatum e≈øt.</hi> The ≈øonne of God came into the world for the ouerthrow of all ≈øinnes: for if hee was, as hee vvas, the truth it ≈øelfe, hee was a great enemy of lies, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he highly loued charitie he hated cruelty, and becau≈øe hee highly commended humilitie, hee per≈øecuted enuy, vvhich vvas the cau≈øe that no man did euer reprehend vice more ≈øharplier than hee, nor no man did euer extoll vertue like vnto him.

The High prie≈øt the ≈øonne of God, did die for all men, and ≈øhed his bloud for all men: but if thou Infidell or Heretike, wilt not enter into the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke church, if thou ≈øinner or naughty man wilt at the time, when it is de≈øtributed turne thy face from it, what fault is in Chri≈øt if his precious bloud worke no vertue in thee? O how happy that ≈øoule is, vpon whom there falleth one drop not of the bloud which the prie≈øt ≈øprinckled, but this precious bloud which the ≈øon of God ≈øheddeth! for being wa≈øhed in ≈øo deep a pool≈øhe wil go beyond the ≈ønow in whitenes, &amp; exceed the ≈øon in clearnes. It is time now for vs to come vnto our fir≈øt purpo≈øe, &amp; apply all this vnto that which holy <hi>Simeon</hi> ≈øpake of Chri≈øt. When <hi>Simeon</hi> ≈øayth of Chri≈øt, that he is put to helpe vp ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and when the Prophet ≈øaith O I≈øraell thy perdition com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of thy ≈øelfe, and thy ≈øaluation of mee, and when <hi>Dauid</hi> ≈øaith, Heale me Lord and I ≈øhal be made whole, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øide Sprinckle me Lord with I≈øope, and I ≈øhal bee made cleane, hee letteth vs vnder≈øtand plainly, that if wee bee not made cleane by the mighty hand of the ≈øon of God, no man el≈øe hath the power to doe it. Wherefore ≈øayth <hi>Irenaeus</hi> did the redeemer of the world come into the world, but becau≈øe wickedne≈ø≈øe and wicked men ≈øhould fall downe, and becau≈øe vertue and vertuous men ≈øhould ri≈øe?

If thou do≈øt come into the world (≈øaith <hi>Vbertinus</hi>) becau≈øe that all naughtine≈ø≈øe and naughty men ≈øhould fall, who in all the world is ≈øo wicked as my ≈øelfe, or who fallen ≈øo low?

Had <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> knife pitie on the ≈øtrumpets child, and had not thy ≈øons knife pitie on his owne mother?

Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that our fir≈øt Parents had tran≈øgre≈ø≈øed the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, our Lord put there pre≈øently a firie ≈øword to keepe Paradi≈øe, becau≈øe no man ≈øhould enter in, to eat of the tree which was forbidden. S. <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> vpon this place ≈øaith, That there was neither ≈øword nor knife in the hou≈øe of God, before that man knew what ≈øinne was, but at the ≈øame houre that he fell from grace to ≈øinne, our Lord put both ≈øword and gibbet in his hou≈øe. Before that man ≈øinned, there was no dore to ≈øhut in the hou≈øe of god, nor Cherubin to watchit, nor ≈øword to defend it: but immediately after man ≈øinned, the gate was ≈øhut, and the key was lo≈øt. What is the ≈øword which we ≈øpeak of here, but onely the ≈øonne of God in whom wee beleeue? The ≈øonne of God is called a ≈øword in the Apocalips, and a ≈øword vvhich cutteth on both ≈øides, becau≈øe hee alone and no other puni≈øheth the bad and defendeth the good, killeth tho≈øe which are aliue, and rai≈øeth tho≈øe vvhich are dead. It vvas in the hands of the Cherubine to let vs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in or not, into the terre≈øtriall Paradi≈øe: and it is in the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:3666:106"/>hands of the ≈øonne of God, vvhether wee ≈øhal enter into the cele≈øtiall Paradi≈øe or not. Wee haue a greater and a better watch in our Paradi≈øe, than <hi>Adam</hi> had in his, becau≈øe that the Cherubin did but ≈øtand at the gate, but the ≈øonne of God is the gate it ≈øelfe. When he ≈øaid I am the gate, what did hee mean el≈øe, but that he was the key with the which we ≈øhould open, he was the gate through the which we ≈øhould enter in, and he the guide which ≈øhould direct vs, and he the Paradi≈øe which we ≈øhould enioy. It is al≈øo to bee noted that the ≈øword with the which the Cherubin kept Paradi≈øe, was neither of ≈øiluer nor gold, nor yron, but was of pure fire, which is a new and an vnu≈øuall thing which no man would beleeue if it were not in Scripture.

This is a high figure, and deepe my≈øtery, worthy of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øideration, becau≈øe in it is figured very much by <hi>Dauid,</hi> and namely the great griefes which Chri≈øt endured.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe that the doctrine which the ≈øonne of God teacheth is of that quality, that although it bee very good to preach it, yet it is farre better to follow it.

For ≈øeeing that he inherited but one ≈øeat of his father <hi>Dauid,</hi> how was it po≈øsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that he ≈øhould deliuer the ≈øynagogue by force of armes? If the Me≈øsias promi≈øed in the old law, ≈øhould bee <hi>Dauids</hi> ≈øonne, and rich and mighty, why did they not receaue king <hi>Salomon</hi> for their Me≈øsias, ≈øeeing that hee inherited from his father armes to deliuer them, power to defend them, trea≈øure to enrich them, and great wi≈ødome to gouerne them?

What ≈øea can bee compared in depth, or what water in bitterne≈ø≈øe, vnto the heart in the which is forged at one time, a will to redeeme all the world, and a will that her ≈øonne ≈øhould not ≈øuffer? For as the ≈øea is deepe, and large, ≈øo the Virgines griefe was deepe, becau≈øe it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vnto the heart, and great becau≈øe it vvas of a great matter, and bitter becau≈øe it was the greate≈øt griefe in the world. <hi>Barnard</hi> ≈øayth, That as in the ≈øea one waue followeth another, and when they are come to the banke, they breake again≈øt it: euen ≈øo in the Virgines mind one ≈øorrow ouerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth another, and one grief ouerreacheth another, the which both together breake again≈øt the Virgines bowels. And ≈øhee ≈øuffered all the≈øe anxieties and ≈øorrowes alone, becau≈øe there was none who might take part of them with her, nor any man

Who ≈øhall cure thee O thou of all other the mo≈øt comfortle≈ø≈øe, becau≈øe the griefes of the heart are ≈øuch, that although they are ea≈øie to bee reckoned, yet they are hard to bee cured? Who ≈øhall heale thee O ble≈ø≈øed Ladie, ≈øeeing thy carefull loue is of ≈øuch qualitie, and the wounds of thy ≈øorrow ≈øo great, that no man can gue≈ø≈øe at the curing of them, but hee alone who was the cau≈øe of them? Who ≈øhall ea≈øe thee of all others the mo≈øt de≈øolate, ≈øeeing that the Phi≈øitian which cured the dolours of the heart, is now crucified among theeues and malefactors?

By the cro≈ø≈øes of theeues doe ≈øit impatient men chiding, couetous men a deceiuing, gluttons a eating, libidenous men a playing the adulterers, malicious men a lying, and ≈ølothfull men a taking their ea≈øe. It was a cro≈ø≈øe by which Chri≈øts poore familie ≈øtood, and they were cro≈ø≈øes by which ≈øouldiors of the deuill ≈øtood, to let vs vnder≈øtand, that they ≈øuffer more cro≈ø≈øes and paines vvhich goe to hell, than tho≈øe which go to heauen. S. <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> ≈øaith, That if thou wilt ≈øee who they are which doe ≈øaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øelues, and what multitude they bee, which condemne them≈øelues, thou maie≈øt ≈øee it by that, that by the cro≈ø≈øe of Chri≈øt there ≈øtood but a few per≈øons; and by the cro≈ø≈øes of the theeues there were a thou≈øand people and more, in ≈øo much that it is in thy choi≈øe either to goe vveeping a foot to heauen, or goe ≈øitting and laughing to hell. <hi>An≈øelmus</hi> vpon the my≈øtery of the cro≈ø≈øe ≈øaith, On the Mount of Caluary there were very many which looked on the cro≈ø≈øe of Chri≈øt a farre off, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few which ≈øtood neere vnto it: and the rea≈øon is, becau≈øe
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:3666:114"/>that by the cro≈ø≈øe of Chri≈øt it is not permitted that any ≈øhould ≈øinne, and by the cro≈ø≈øes of the theeues, it is lawfull for euery man to ≈øteale and ≈øinne. O my ≈øoule, and O my heart, why doe≈øt thou not melt, and yeeld vp the gho≈øt, ≈øeeing the drops of bloud which de≈øcend vpon our Lady, and the ≈øighes of our Lady which a≈øcend vnto our Lord? Doe≈øt thou not marke O my ≈øoule, doe≈øt thou not marke how the ≈øorrowfull mother is bathed with the bloud which runneth from her ≈øonne, and how the earth is watered with the teares which fall from her eies? <hi>Barnard</hi> ≈øayth, What offences can there bee ≈øo great in the world, which the bloud of the ≈øonne cannot remedy, and the teares of the mother cannot wa≈øh away? Behold O my heart ≈øaith <hi>Bonauenture,</hi> and thou ≈øhalt ≈øee the ≈øonne vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, and the mother at the foot of the cro≈ø≈øe, ≈øhee is on foot, and he lifted vp, ≈øhe holdeth her peace, and he ≈øpeaketh no word, and that which is mo≈øt of all, they looke vpon one the other with their eies, and vnder≈øtand one another vvith their hearts. O my fingers and you my pennes, giue ouer vvri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting I pray you, becau≈øe I may meditate the better how the mother ≈øaw her ≈øonne ≈øhed drops of bloud, and the ≈øonne ≈øaw the mother ≈øhed teares from her heart. What hearts ≈øhould they haue which had ≈øuch eies? Who can write this and not ≈øigh, and who can read it, and not be heauy for it, that is, how the mothers heart was full of griefe for that which ≈øhee ≈øaw, and the ≈øons heartful of loue for that which he ≈øuffered? And by that meanes there was a cruell debate betwixt the ≈øorrow of the mother and the loue of the ≈øonne. Note well (≈øayth <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertinus</hi>) that he who was vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, and tho≈øe vvhich were neere the cro≈ø≈øe, they were all ≈øtanding, and none ≈øitting, which is to giue vs vnder≈øtanding of the ≈øweet ta≈øt of the cro≈ø≈øe, and of the high my≈øteries contained in him, whereof hee did impart none vnto tho≈øe which leaned or ≈øate at their ea≈øe, but vnto tho≈øe which ≈øtood on their feet. <hi>Non coques hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum in lacte matris,</hi> Deutronomy, chap. 24. as if he would ≈øay, Let no man bee ≈øo bold as to ≈øeeth the fle≈øh of the kid in the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:3666:115"/>milke of his damme, but let them eat the goats milke by it ≈øelfe, and eat the kid by him≈øelfe, and the law did permit the damme to be milked, and the kid to be killed. If there vvere no other my≈øtery in this, what did God care whether the kid were ≈øod in his mothers milke or not? <hi>Origen</hi> ≈øaith, If it be wel noted, the law doth forbid the kid to bee ≈øod in the milke of the goat, but the law did not forbid to ≈øeeth the goat in the bloud of the kid. In which my≈øtery he did let vs vnder≈øtand, that the holy mother the church was to be ≈øod, &amp; ≈øaued in the bloud of Chri≈øt, and not Chri≈øt in the bloud of the church. On that di≈ømall and vnluckie day, vpon the high Mount of Caluary, the goat and the kid met together, which vvere Chri≈øt and his mother, in which place again≈øt all rea≈øon and law, they did at one time ≈øeeth the ≈øon in the mothers milke, and the mother in the ≈øonnes bloud. From whence i≈ø≈øued out the bloud, but out of the vaines of the ≈øonne, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> whence came the milke, but from the mothers eies? O goodne≈ø≈øe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hard of before, O vn≈øpeakable ≈øorrow! who did euer ≈øee or heare of a mother who ≈øhed ≈øo many tears, as were inough to bath her ≈øonne in them, or of a ≈øonne from whom came ≈øo much bloud, as was inough to ≈øeeth his mother in? It appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth well, that they v≈øed them≈øelues like mother and child, and that they loued like bride and bridegroome, ≈øeeing ≈øhee gaue him di≈øtilled teares, and hee gaue her ≈øtrained bloud. <hi>Barnard</hi> in an Homily ≈øaith, O of all women mo≈øt ble≈ø≈øed, O mother of my dolours, vvhat ≈øonne had euer ≈øuch a mother as he had, or what mother had euer ≈øuch a ≈øonne as thou ha≈øt, ≈øeeing thou didde≈øt conceiue him being a Virgine, brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te≈øt him forth with ioy, broughte≈øt him vp with milke, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed≈øt him with ≈øweats, and buried≈øt him with teares? What could ≈øhe doe more for him, than follow him with infinit tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell and paines, and bury him with remedile≈ø≈øe teares? And what could hee doe more for her, than chu≈øe her for his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and redeeme her vvith his bloud? <hi>An≈øelmus</hi> vpon the Conception ≈øaith, That from the beginning of the vvorld
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:3666:115"/>vntill this day, there was neuer milke better paied for, than that which Chri≈øt ≈øucked of his mother: for if ≈øhee gaue him milke out of hir precious brea≈øts, hee gaue her bloud out of his holy members. Who euer heard before, or ≈øaw bloud pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for milke, or milke for bloud? Who can e≈øtimate or ≈øet a price on the bloud which ≈øtreamed from the ≈øonne, or of the tears which ran from the mother? O good Ie≈øus, O redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of my ≈øoule, had it not beene better for thee, and le≈ø≈øer griefe for thy mother to haue ≈øod thee in the milke of her brea≈øts, rather than in the tears of her eies?

<pb n="226" facs="tcp:3666:116"/>much that he ≈øhould neither take her, nor much le≈ø≈øe kil her. What other thing is it to goe a hunting for Sparrowes ne≈øts, but to ≈øeeke out diuine bookes? <hi>Origen</hi> ≈øayth, Who or what is the ne≈øt but the booke, what the Sparrow but the letter, &amp; which the young ones but the ≈øences, and who the hunter but the Chri≈øtian which occupieth him≈øelfe in holy Scripture? When God commaundeth the hunter to leane the mother, and take the young ones, he doth plainly adui≈øe vs, that wee ≈øhould leaue the letter in the ne≈øt of the holy Scripture, and take the meaning. Hee doth leaue the Sparrow in the ne≈øt which careth not for that which the letter ≈øoundeth, but for that which the holy Go≈øpell ≈øaith, Becau≈øe there bee ≈øome ≈øuch ob≈øcure phra≈øes in ≈øcripture, that they are not onely not to be taken as they ≈øound, but al≈øo that not to be done which the very letter commandeth. When Chri≈øt ≈øayth, If thy eie doe ≈øcandalize thee, it was not his meaning that wee ≈øhould pull out our corporall eies which we ≈øee with, but the ≈øpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all with the which we damne our ≈øelues; for Chri≈øts ≈øweet law doth command no man to teare his own members, but to pul out ≈øinnes by the root. When wee loue a child well, wee ≈øay that wee loue him like our owne eies, and thereupon Chri≈øt ≈øaith, if any of thy eies doe ≈øcandale thee, pull him out. Saint <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> ≈øaith, That all the Synagogues perdition con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øteth, becau≈øe that in the ne≈øt of the Scripture, they take the mother, and leaue the young ones, that is, they take the letter as it ≈øoundeth, and take not the ≈øence which is hidden vnder it, making more account of the drie barke, then of the tender marrow. When the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith, that the letter killeth, and that it is the ≈øpirit which doth giue life, what el≈øe doth he ≈øay, but that we ≈øhould take heed of taking the old Sparrow, and that wee ≈øhould take the young ones which vvas the ≈øence? When the ≈øonne of God ≈øaith, Search the ≈øcriptures, he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not that we ≈øhould read the bookes only, but that vvee ≈øhould ≈øeeke out the true ≈øence thereof. If wicked <hi>Arrius</hi> had ≈øearched out the meaning of tho≈øe words, My father is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:3666:116"/>than I am, &amp; of tho≈øe other words, That they may be one as I and my Father are one, there ≈øhould neuer ≈øo many good men haue been per≈øecuted, nor ≈øo many ≈øcandales haue ri≈øen in the church by it. Seeing that all liuing bea≈øts are created for mans v≈øes and ≈øeruice, if our Lord had meaned no other matter in the ≈øparrowes ne≈øts, then the letter ≈øpeaketh of, hee would neuer haue bidden vs eat of the one, and not touch the other. It had beene a greater lo≈ø≈øe to the Commonwealth to kill fiue or ≈øixe young ones, than one old one: but becau≈øe the giuer of the law did intend rather the my≈øtery, which was ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in the ≈øparrowes, than the prohibition which hee made when he commanded the young ones to be taken, &amp; the old one to bee let lou≈øe. Conformably then vnto that which our Lord commandeth, let the curious Reader leaue the letter and take the true ≈øence: otherwi≈øe it were better for him not to read the Scripture, than vnder≈øtand it as the Synagogue doth. To come then vnto our purpo≈øe, what is the ne≈øt but the holy cro≈ø≈øe of Chri≈øt? Who the ≈øparrow but our ble≈ø≈øed Lady?

According vnto the old law the young ≈øpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes might bee taken and killed, and ≈øo they did by Chri≈øt: and wherefore then was his poore mother ≈øo grieuou≈øly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented there, who was figured in the ≈øparrow, ≈øeeing ≈øhe was exempted by law? O wicked Ieru≈øalem, and cur≈øed Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue! ≈øeeing that in the ne≈øt of the cro≈ø≈øe, thou didde≈øt find the old bird and the yong, why art thou not content to kil the young one, but doe≈øt al≈øo torment the mother? O holy tree, O precious ne≈øt, O ble≈ø≈øed ≈øonne, O comfortle≈ø≈øe mother, what heart could de≈øtroy that holy ne≈øt, in the which all the holy Trinitie was inclo≈øed? In the high ne≈øt of the cro≈ø≈øe, the father was he who commanded the ≈øonne to ≈øuffer, the holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gho≈øt which a≈øsi≈øted, the fle≈øh which died, the foule which

Why doe I ≈øay that ≈øhee kept ≈øome part of her heart vnto her ≈øelfe, ≈øeeing that all her heart liued and died with her ≈øonne? If the heart doe run to de≈øire that which the cies behold, and if whither the heart goeth there goeth al≈øo the very bowels to continue, where was all the Virgines heart, but in her ≈øonne whom ≈øhe be≈øt beloued? Becau≈øe the dolefull mother had no other ≈øonne but him, all her loue was fixed in him, and becau≈øe the Iewes found the Sparrow and her young one in the ne≈øt of the Cro≈ø≈øe, they crucified the fle≈øh of Chri≈øt, and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the mothers heart. Saint <hi>Barnard</hi> ≈øayth, That if the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines brea≈øts had been opened in that ≈øorrowfull houre &amp; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable day, it is religiou≈øly to bee thought, they might haue found her heart of fle≈øh, but not the force and vigour of a heart, becau≈øe her vitall ≈øpirits had mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and her true loue buried it vvith her ≈øonne.

As if he would ≈øay, Let tho≈øe take heed which will offer to the Tabernacle, that they doe not kill the lambe and the ewe the ≈øame day. <hi>Origen</hi> ≈øayth, That becau≈øe our Lord is mercifull, hee would haue his di≈øciples bee ≈øo likewi≈øe, and therefore he did forbid them any thing that might tend vnto cruelty, or induce them vnto it. What can be more cruell than to take the lambe and the owe at one time? Who is the ewe which hath brought forth the lambe, but only the mother of Chri≈øt, and who the lambe but her precious ≈øonne? God did warn the ≈øynagogue often that they vvould take heed vnto the Lambe and ewe, and e≈øpecially that if they would touch the ≈øonne, that they vvould pardon the mother. God had no greater wealth nor any equal neither in heauen nor in earth, vnto that lambe and ≈øheep, of whom he him≈øelfe had a care, and in who≈øe ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice and guard all the powers of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> were by him emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This commandement was broken on the Mount of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uary, where they at one time, killed the innocent lambe, and ≈øpared not the ≈øorrowfull mother. What cruelty and inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie like vnto this was euer ≈øeen or heard of, haung but one ≈øheep in the Synagogue, &amp; the church hauing but one lamb, to kill the lambe in the pre≈øence of his mother, and torment
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:3666:118"/>the ewe in the ≈øight of the Lambe? What equall torment could there bee to the mother than to kill her ≈øon before hir face, or what greater martyrdome could the ≈øon ≈øuffer, than to ≈øacrifice his mother in his ≈øight? O how glorious and happy ≈øhould I be if my ≈øoule would turn to be ≈øuch an ewe, and my heart ≈øuch a lambe, becau≈øe I might bee ≈øacrificed on the Mount of Caluary with the true Lambe! O ≈øweet Ie≈øus (≈øaith <hi>Vbertinus</hi>) O mercifull Lord, ≈øeeing that all lawes doe ≈øpeake in fauour of thy precious mother, why woulde≈øt thou breake them, ≈øeeing thou art the iudge of them all?

The rea≈øon why our good Ie≈øus would take his mother with him, was (as <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelmus</hi> ≈øayth) Becau≈øe hee would leaue her his onely inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trize, as being the next of kindred. O my ≈øingers, O my heart, how is it po≈øsible for you to bee able to write, or my tongue able to ≈øpeake of the wealth which the ≈øonne leaueth, or of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:3666:118"/>the inheritance which the mother doth inherite? But what could hee leaue vnto his mother who was borne in Bethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem among bea≈øts, &amp; died on the Mount of Caluary betwixt theeues? What can his ≈øorrowfull mother inherite of him who ≈øhrowdeth him≈øelfe in a borrowed ≈øhrowd, and burieth him≈øelfe in another mans ≈øepulchre? What could hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath by Te≈øtament, who hauing two coats, gaue one to the hangmen which crucified him, and the other to the knights vvhich kept him? What could hee leaue vvho neuer had a foorme to ≈øet downe on, nor a boul≈øter to lay his head on? The inheritance then which ≈øhe did there inherite from her ≈øonne, was the bloud which there hee ≈øhed, and the dolours which hee there ≈øuffered for all men, ≈øo that with the bloud which came downe from the cro≈ø≈øe, hee watered her body, and with the dolours which hee ≈øuffered, hee martyred her ≈øoule. Saint <hi>Barnard De pa≈øsione domini</hi> ≈øaith, That in ≈øo great and high a work as this was, and in ≈øo narrow a ≈øtrait as this which Chri≈øt was in, it was very nece≈ø≈øary that the Virgine ≈øhould bee there, and giue her ≈øonne part of all that was in her, not onely to haue compa≈øsion on him, but al≈øo to ≈øuffer with him. S. <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> vpon the pa≈øsion of our Lord ≈øayth, That becau≈øe the great prophecy of <hi>Simeon</hi> was not as yet accompli≈øhed, it was done by the permi≈øson and coun≈øell of the holy gho≈øt, that the mother ≈øhould be with the ≈øonne on the Mount of Caluary, where at one time the ≈øword of grief bereaued the ≈øon of his life, and pierced the mothers ≈øoule. As it was not rea≈øon (≈øaith <hi>An≈øelmus</hi>) that the mother of God ≈øhould want the crowne and reward of martyrdome, ≈øo was it not rea≈øon that ≈øhe ≈øhould be put into tyrants ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ds, &amp; therfore it was giuen her as a meane, that becau≈øe ≈øhee had ≈øerued her ≈øonne with exce≈øsiue loue, her own ≈øonne ≈øhould martyre her with his in≈øpeakable griefs. Who euer ≈øaw or heard, that as it were at one ≈øound and after one mea≈øure, the hangmen ≈øhould martyrize the ≈øon, &amp; the ≈øon martyrize his mother. S. <hi>Barnard</hi> vpon tho≈øe words, <hi>Maior e≈øt iniquitas mea,</hi> which <hi>Cain</hi> ≈øpake, ≈øayth thus: O good Ie≈øus that, that charity is greater vvhich
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:3666:119"/>thou didde≈øt v≈øe, than that which thou didde≈øt command me O redeemer of my ≈øoule, ≈øeeing that on the Mount of Calua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Friday which thou didde≈øt ≈øuffer vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, thou didde≈øt not only put thy owne life for vs, but al≈øo thy ble≈ø≈øed mothers.

The rea≈øon is to bee knowne vvhy the ≈øonne of God did change his manner of ≈øpeaking rather in this ≈øpeech, than in all the others which hee v≈øed, as the Euangeli≈øts do record it, ≈øaying, <hi>Heloij, heloij, lamaza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bathani.</hi> Was it becau≈øe hee ≈øhould be vnder≈øtood of all men, ≈øeeing that hee vvas crucified for all men?

It is al≈øo very much to be noted, why hee doth rather complaine that his Father had for≈øaken him, than put him to death: ≈øeeing that hee knew very well that <hi>Pilate</hi> was not of power to take away his life from him, if his eternall father had not giuen him licen≈øe to doe it? And although hee did complaine of his Father, vvhy did hee not ≈øay, My Father why doe≈øt thou for≈øake mee, but My God vvhy ha≈øt thou for≈øaken mee, making account of that vvhich hee hath ≈øuffered, and not of that vvhich then hee did ≈øuffer? Although all the≈øe thinges are ea≈øily rehear≈øed, yet they are not ea≈øie to bee expounded: but becau≈øe they are diuine ≈øecrets, and done betwixt diuine per≈øons onely they pa≈ø≈øe mans capacity, yea the Angels vnder≈øtanding.

<pb n="235" facs="tcp:3666:120"/>is his Father: that whereof hee complaineth is becau≈øe hee had for≈øaken him: the place where, was on the cro≈ø≈øe: and hee complained before his mother with the≈øe words, My God, my God, why ha≈øt thou for≈øaken mee. The≈øe are mo≈øt pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full words to heare, and tender to prouoke vs to weepe: for if vve con≈øider how the ≈øonne of God ≈øpake them being nailed vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, his body naked, and his enemies round about him, and that vpon a dunghill, what heart is there that would not breake to thinke on it? Seeing wee know, beleeue, and confe≈ø≈øe, that Chri≈øt was true God, and that his father was al≈øo God, and both were but one God, how can it enter into mans vnder≈øtanding that one who is God ≈øhould complaine vpon him who is al≈øo God? If between one God and another there bee complaints, is it any great matter if men ≈øometimes fall at ods? Wee ≈øee it fall out daily, that the ≈øonne complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of the Father, and one friend vpon another, yea &amp; one man vpon him≈øelfe, but that Chri≈øt who is God ≈øhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine vpon his father who is God, it is a thing neuer heard of before, nor humane weakene≈ø≈øe is not able to conceiue it. For ≈øeeing no man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>plaineth on another but for ≈øome wrong done vnto him, what grieuance could the eternall Father haue done vnto his ≈øonne whom he loued ≈øo well? For ≈øeeing we know that Chri≈øt is the ≈øonne of God and his onely belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ≈øonne, and with whome God hath left all his trea≈øures in keeping, how is it po≈øsible that God ≈øhould haue dealt hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with him, ≈øeeing that he de≈øerued it not, neither his father de≈øired it? According vnto that which we haue ≈øaid our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon is good which way ≈øo euer wee doe wind our ≈øelues: for if wee ≈øay that the father did that vnto his ≈øonne, which hee ought not, wee can neither ≈øay it nor affirme it: then if we ≈øay that the ≈øonne complained vvithout occa≈øion, we dare not pre≈øume ≈øo to ≈øay, in ≈øo much that we mu≈øt deliuer the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all fault, and allow the ≈øonnes complaint to bee good.

It is a new ≈øpeech and a grieuous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, to ≈øay that the father ≈øhould breake his anger vpon his ≈øonne, and that hee maketh his ≈øoule afeard. And therefore it is nece≈ø≈øary for vs to ≈øhew what anger is, and how it can be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified that there is anger in God. <hi>Po≈øsidonius</hi> the Philo≈øopher being asked what anger was, an≈øwered, In my opinion anger is nothing el≈øe but a ≈øhort and a ≈øuddaine folly. <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> defy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it ≈øaid, that anger was but a kindeling of the bloud, an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration and mouing of the heart, a forgetting of wit &amp; ≈øence, and a troubling of the iudgement. <hi>E≈øchines</hi> being demanded from whence anger proceeded, ≈øaid that it proceeded from the heat of the bloud, and of the abundance of choller, and a vapour of the gaule, and fiercene≈ø≈øe of the heart. <hi>Macrobius</hi> ≈øayth, That no man ≈øhould chide with one that chideth, nor with him who is chidden, vntill the cau≈øe be knowne on both ≈øides: for the cau≈øe is not in the anger which wee ≈øhew in chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but in the iu≈øtice or iniu≈øtice of the cau≈øe for which wee chide. <hi>Seneca</hi> in his fir≈øt booke of Anger ≈øayth, That the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of an angry man are, not to beleeue his friends, to bee

Then wee yeeld our will vnto anger, when wee begin to trouble our ≈øelues with ≈ømall matters, and then anger doth that which is not our wil, when in great matters we would not be angry: in ≈øo much that if wee doe not re≈øi≈øt anger in the beginning, we ≈øhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer or late ca≈øt it out of our hou≈øe. Wee haue ≈øpoken all this to the end that wee ≈øhould maruell the more how it ≈øhould be in God, and how he ≈øhould bee moued like a man, ≈øeeing that as there is no man able to take his eternall being from him, ≈øo there is no man able any way to trouble him. Who ≈øhould bee able to trouble him, ≈øeeing wee know that God is a ≈øpirit, and hath no heart in his brea≈øt, no bloud in his vaines, no vapour ri≈øing from his gaule, no gaule in his lights, no forgetfulne≈ø≈øe in his memory, no alteration in his iudgement?

Are they not the ≈øtronge≈øt of all, ≈øeeing they rule and mai≈øterall? <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> vpon the Apo≈øtles words ≈øayth, Of three enemies which we haue, ≈øinne is the ≈øtronge≈øt of them al; becau≈øe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny holy men, haue gone before vs in old times, vpon whom although the deuill and the world haue had no power, yet notwith≈øtanding ≈øin hath had a dwelling place in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe there did neuer man liue ≈øo cleane, who knew not what ≈øinne was. <hi>Ca≈øsiodorus</hi> ≈øayth, I for my part, thinke ≈øinne more mightier than any other enemy, becau≈øe the world and the diuell can but deceiue me, but wicked ≈øin can hurt me &amp; damn me. For if there were no manner of ≈øin in the world, we ≈øhould need neither gallowes nor ≈øword. Chri≈øt onely may ≈øay, hee hath deliuered me from my enemies, becau≈øe he &amp; no other was free from ≈øinne, becau≈øe all other creatures knew what ≈øinne was, and all knew what puni≈øhment for it was. O how happy a man he ≈øhould be, who could ≈øay with the Prophet, he hath deliuered me from my ≈øtronge≈øt enemies! for it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:3666:126"/>el≈øe to ≈øay that God hath deliuered him from his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but that our Lord hath deliuered him from his ≈øinnes. The Prophet had great rea≈øon to call ≈øinne not only an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but al≈øo his ≈øtronge≈øt enemy, ≈øeeing that without other helpe, he threw the Angell out of heauen, ca≈øt <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradi≈øe, depriued <hi>Iudas</hi> of his Apo≈øtle≈øhip, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all the world to death. Is not ≈øinne thinke you the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie≈øt of all other enemies, ≈øeeing that hee is able and ≈øtrong i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to carry mee to hell? The power of my vi≈øible ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my reacheth no further than to take my life from mee, but ≈øinne the Traitour is an enemy ≈øo ≈øtrong, that hee is able to take my life from me, depriue me of grace, ca≈øt me out of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, hurt my ≈øoule, and condemne mee vnto paine. Who had ≈øuch enemies as the ≈øonne of God had; that is, ≈øo wicked in their cogitations, ≈øo malicious in their ≈øpeech, and ≈øo cruell in their deedes? Were not the la≈øhes which opened Chri≈øts ≈øhoulders very cruell enemies, the nailes which broke his ≈øinewes, the thornes which tore his temples, and the ≈øpeare which opened his ≈øide, and the Synagogue which tooke his life from him? Yet Chri≈øt called none of all the≈øe his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, nor did not handle them like his enemies, but only ≈øins, which hee did not only call enemies, but mighty and ≈øtrong enemies, giuing vs therby to vnder≈øtand, that we ≈øhould hold none for our enemie but onely ≈øinne. When good king <hi>Dauid</hi> ≈øaid, <hi>Per≈øequar inimicos meos &amp; comprehendam illos,</hi> Hee ≈øpake it not in re≈øpect of the enemies which per≈øecuted his per≈øon, but for ≈øinnes which did damnifie his ≈øoule. For ≈øeeing that good king <hi>Dauid</hi> did pardon <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Simei,</hi> and others his mortall enemies, how could hee coun≈øell vs that wee ≈øhould per≈øecute ours? When he ≈øaith I will per≈øecute my enemies vntill I de≈øtroy them, he ≈øpake of no other enemies but of his ≈øinnes, the which it is conuenient for vs to per≈øecute, and ca≈øt from vs. And it is not without a my≈øtery that hee ≈øayth <hi>Per≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quar &amp; comprehendam,</hi> Becau≈øe that as the enemy which is offended, if he be not taken, turneth againe and biddeth vs a

And hee ≈øaith further, that when my friend dieth in him whom I loued, halfe of my ≈øelfe died with him, and halfe of him remaineth aliue with mee, in ≈øo much that by my will I ≈øhould die, if it were not to keepe that part of him which remained in me aliue. This vertue of friend≈øhip could not bee better prai≈øed, than this Philo≈øopher hath done it, ≈øeeing hee doth confe≈ø≈øe, that halfe of him≈øelfe is in the graue with his friend, and that halfe of his friend was aliue in his ≈øoule, and that he de≈øired to liue for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, but becau≈øe his friend ≈øhould not die in him. To come then vnto our purpo≈øe, if all this be true, we ≈øhould haue great compa≈øsion vpon Chri≈øt, ≈øeeing his Father tooke his friends from him, ≈øeparated his kin from him, &amp; left him no comfort by his acquaintance. It is much to be noted, that Chri≈øt doth complaine that his Father took but one friend fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> him, &amp; one kin≈øman, but many of his acquaintance; to note vnto vs, that of faithfull friends there is ≈øcar≈øe one to be found, and of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous kin≈ømen hardly one, but of acquaintance a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. O that hee knoweth but meanly what friend≈øhip is, who putteth a friend, a kin≈øman, and his acquaintance vnder one reckoning, becau≈øe that I am to call him only my friend who loueth me, &amp; him my kin≈øma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> who is a good Chri≈øtian, &amp; all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my neighbours &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>panions my acquaintance. To ≈øpeak properly, Chri≈øt had but one friend only who was his Father, &amp; no other friend like vnto him; &amp; one only which was of his kindred, who was his mother, &amp; none other like vnto her: but
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:3666:128"/>he had great acquaintance among the Iews: &amp; in that great conflict which he had in his pa≈øsion, his friend for≈øooke him, his kindred did not helpe him, and his acquaintaince ≈øhewed them≈øelues vngratefull. Thou didde≈øt remoue farre from me, my friend, ≈øeeing that thou O my Father, woulde≈øt not heare me when I praied vnto thee in the garden following the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the fle≈øh: and thou didde≈øt remoue my kin from me, ≈øeeing that my mother could not help me on the Mount of Caluary; and thou didde≈øt remoue my acquaintance from me, ≈øeeing that there I was put to death by them. O in what great danger, and in what a narrow ≈øtrait the ≈øon of God vvas at the time of his pa≈øsion, ≈øeeing he complaineth that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did not heare him, his mother did not helpe him, and none of his friends would know him.

Becau≈øe God was the highe≈øt and chiefe≈øt goodne≈ø≈øe that was, and man incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto wickedne≈ø≈øe, God did command him to better and amend him≈øelfe: vnto which he an≈øwered that he would bee merry and take his plea≈øure; by rea≈øon whereof man went e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day wor≈øe and wor≈øe, and God more angry and incen≈øed euery day again≈øt him. Pope <hi>Leo</hi> ≈øayth, That God doth not weigh whether we be weake or ≈øtrong, in health or ≈øicke, rich or poore, ≈øimple or wi≈øe, but that which he de≈øireth, is that we ≈øhould be good, and he is angry if we be naught: and therup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is, that hee neuer ca≈øteth any good man out of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence, nor hee admitteth no naughty man into his hou≈øe. <hi>Gregory</hi> ≈øayth, That hee could not ≈øuffer one ≈øinne in him who was an Angell, and doe≈øt thou thinke he will ≈øuffer ≈øo many ≈øinnes in thee who art but a man? And hee ≈øayth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that God would rather ≈øuffer, that an Angell ≈øhould take heauen from him, and man the world, than ≈øuffer one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øinne either in the one or in the other; becau≈øe that to make a new heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> he is of ≈øufficient power, but to like and approue a ≈øinne, neither is his power able to doe it, neither can it bee comprehended vnder his clemency. Seeing then that God is ≈øuch an enemie vnto ≈øinne, and ≈øeeing that man doth ≈øo much couet to ≈øinne, how can they bee but contrary the one vnto the other, and v≈øe one another like enemies? Holy <hi>Iob</hi> doth weepe and ≈øigh, ≈øaying, <hi>Non e≈øt qui po≈ø≈øit vtrumque arguere,</hi> that is, there was no man who dur≈øt be a mediator betwixt them, nor put him≈øelfe betweene them, to the end that man might giue ouer ≈øinning, &amp; God withdraw his hand from puni≈øhing. <hi>Dama≈øcen</hi> ≈øayth, When God and man, and man and God, were at ≈øtrife and variance, and the one alwaies aboue in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and the other continually vpon the earth, there vvas no
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:3666:129"/>meane to make them meet, nor no court to agree them in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe there came none downe from heauen to vs, nor any fit per≈øon went hence from vs to heauen. The ≈øon of God came the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> into the world, and put him≈øelf a mediator between them both, that is, betweene God and fle≈øh. O how much wee are bound to Chri≈øt for that which he did for vs, and much more for the manner with the which he did it! for the more to bind the one and the other, he tooke the diuinity of his Father with the which he might pardon vs, and tooke fle≈øh of man, with the which hee might ≈øuffer with vs. In ≈øo much that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he tooke his kindred and alliance of both, hee was able to make them both friends. O how co≈øtly this friend≈øhip and kindred was to the ≈øon of God, and grieuous al≈øo, ≈øeeing that it did co≈øt him his bloud which was in him, &amp; the life which hee po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed ≈øo farre forth, that for to make mee friends with God, he became an enemy vnto him≈øelfe. It is certaine that when two enemies doe draw their vveapons to fight, if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther venter in betwixt them, that both their blowes do light vpon him, in ≈øo much that hee vvho parreth them is hurt or ≈ølaine, and tho≈øe which were at debate proue after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward good friends. On the Mount of Caluary, and on the altar of the cro≈ø≈øe, as God and man, and man and God, had ≈øummoned the one the other to a place of defiance, ble≈ø≈øed Ie≈øus put him≈øelfe betwixt them both to cut off the ≈øtrife, becau≈øe hee knew that if hee had not taken away all anger at that place, they vvould haue remained perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all enemies. As man threw ≈øinnes at God, and God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment vpon man, it fell out that the ≈øinne which man fought with, and the puni≈øhment with the which God did cha≈øti≈øe, fell all vpon the Mediatour who had not de≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it. O good Ie≈øus and glory of my ≈øoule, vpon whome but vpon thee did thy Father lay his old anger, vpon whome but vpon thee did man lay his fault? Doe not then vexe thy ≈øelfe O holy <hi>Iob,</hi> and ≈øaie, <hi>Non est qui ponat manum ≈øuam in ambobus,</hi> ≈øeeing hee is already come from heauen, and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:3666:130"/>already borne in the world vvho hath put his hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and man, yea and hath both his hands cut off by them? Haue not they both trow you cut off his hand, ≈øeeing his Father ordained that hee ≈øhould die, and man put the fault on him for which hee ≈øhould bee crucified? O diuine mediatour, O holy ≈øtickeler! which of the Angels could doe the like, or vvhat man could attempt that which thou ha≈øt done? That is willingly, and vpon good and long deliberation, thou didde≈øt offer thy ≈øelfe to lo≈øe thy life, to ≈øet God and man in concord and vnitie. The ≈øonne of God then doth complaine vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Father with iu≈øt cau≈øe, ≈øaying, Why ha≈øt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaken mee? ≈øeeing that hee did load all his wrath vpon his backe, and man likewi≈øe lay all the burden of his ≈øinnes vpon his ≈øhoulders, vpon him in that place God did emptie all his wrath, and in that place mans ≈øinnes tooke their end. O that this is a glorious time, and a happie age which vvee of the Catholicke church liue in! for hauing Chri≈øt for our Mediatour, there can no ≈øinne goe vp to the Father, but it mu≈øt fir≈øt meet with Chri≈øt, nor any puni≈øhment come downe vpon man, but it mu≈øt al≈øo come by him. The ≈øonne of God being a meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his Father and vs, who doubteth but that hee will ≈øtop our ≈øinne in him≈øelfe, that it a≈øcend not to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and al≈øo keepe backe the puni≈øhment of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it doe not de≈øcend into the world?

The ≈øonne of God ≈øpake the≈øe words, continuing his complaint again≈øt his Father: and it is as if hee would ≈øay, What meaneth this O my Father, what meaneth this? Wa≈øt thou not content to breake thy anger vpon me, and remoue all my friends from me, but now anew thou wilt compa≈ø≈øe mee with a great floud of water, in the which my life is drowned? Chri≈øt doth ≈øet foorth at large all his trauails, and bewaileth the want of friends: for hee ≈øayth that the waters were great, and he ≈øaith twi≈øe that they be≈øie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him, and that they came all together vpon him, and that they came ≈øo ragingly, that they tooke away all his forces. Fir≈øt of all, we mu≈øt examine here of what kind of waters our Lord ≈øpeaketh in this place, whether they bee ≈øea waters, or of a riuer, or fountaine, or of a lake, becau≈øe that in all the≈øe a man may drowne him≈øelfe, and lo≈øe his life. We read onely of two puni≈øhments which God hath inflicted by waters, the one in the floud of <hi>Noe,</hi> in which almo≈øt all the world peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhed, the other which he v≈øed again≈øt the people of Aegypt in the red ≈øea; the which two puni≈øhments were ≈øo famous, that our Lord hath not v≈øed the like vntill this day. The ≈øonne of God dooth not complaine of this kind of floud, nor wee doe not read that he euer was in danger by water: for being Lord of all the waters, how is it po≈øsible that he ≈øhould bee drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the waters?

The waters of tribulation, and the floud of vexation entred into no mans heart ≈øo deepely, as into our Sauiours: for ≈øeeing that we were the cau≈øe of them all, as he did loue vs from the heart, ≈øo hee did feele them from the heart. It is to bee noted, that hee doth not ≈øay that the water did wet him, or bemite him, or make him afraid, for all the≈øe things doe not kill, but onely put vs in feare.

Chri≈øt ≈øayth then, they haue compa≈ø≈øed me about like vnto water, becau≈øe that if he did looke vpward, hee ≈øaw his Father who would not ≈øeeme to heare him, if downward he ≈øaw but his mother, who could doe nothing but weepe for him, if hee did looke on the left hand he ≈øaw but a thiefe, who would not beleeue in him, if on the other hand hee ≈øaw another thiefe who could not helpe him. He was compa≈ø≈øed on euery ≈øide: for if hee ≈øhould haue looked behind, he ≈øhould haue ≈øeene the hangmen watching him, and before him the Iewes a mocking him.

If thou wilt know where, how, and by whome I haue receiued the≈øe wounds and ga≈øhes, know thou that I haue receiued them in the hou≈øe of ≈øuch as loued me, and they gaue them me who bare me good will. Looke how new and ≈øtrange this que≈øtion is, ≈øo maruellous is the an≈øwere; and how maruellous the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwere, ≈øo ≈øtrange the que≈øtion: for it is a very ≈øtrange thing that God ≈øhould goe to heauen with wounds vpon him; and to ≈øay that his friends gaue them him, is al≈øo a very maruellous thing, becau≈øe it is the part of a friend to cure our wounds, and of an enemy to make them. What is this O good Ie≈øus, what is this? How can hee vvho loueth thee vvound thee, and hee who wi≈øheth thee well hurt thee, and hee who woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thee take pitie on thee, and hee vvho ≈øerueth thee offend thee? <hi>An≈øelmus</hi> handling this place ≈øayth, O eternall goodne≈ø≈øe of thee my God, and patience neuer before this time ≈øeene, ≈øeeing thou doe≈øt call them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly thy friends which rent thy fle≈øh, vvre≈øt thy ≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes, vnioint thy bones! To ≈øay O good Ie≈øus that thou vva≈øt vvounded in the hou≈øe of ≈øuch as loued thee, is a ≈øpeech vvhich ≈øheweth thy clemency, and giueth
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:3666:133"/>me great confidence: for if thou doe call tho≈øe thy friends which doe wound thee and kill thee, what wilt thou doe by them which faithfully haue ≈øerued thee? Chri≈øt had one hou≈øe in Iury, which was Ieru≈øalem, and hee had a friend in heauen which was his Father, and he had another friend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth which was the Synagogue, and in that hou≈øe he was put to death, and hee was wounded by tho≈øe two friends: for the Synagogue did crucifie him, and his Father did deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that he ≈øhould be crucified. If the Gentiles which were not his friends &amp; acquaintance ≈øhould haue put him to death, it would haue been tollerable: but to ≈øee that he was wounded &amp; ≈ølain in the city where he had liued, &amp; by his friends which he had made much of, &amp; by the wil of his Father which begat him, did grieue him very much, although he did di≈ø≈øemble it. <hi>Barnard</hi> ≈øaith, The more I think vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> thy works O good Ie≈øus, the more I wonder; ≈øeeing that man hauing done the deeds of an enemy towards thee, thou can≈øt not call him enemy but friend, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øidering that thou ≈øai≈øt, I haue been wounded in the hou≈øe of ≈øuch as did loue me. By which words hee doth let vs vnder≈øtand, that he regardeth more the loue which hee bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vnto the world, than the offences which the world doth vnto him. If as good Ie≈øus ≈øaid vnto the Angels, my friends haue thus wounded me, hee would haue ≈øaid vnto his Father that his enemies had done it, what ≈øhould then haue become of the poore Iewes, and what afterward of vs all? As when friends in ie≈øting doe hurt and ≈øcratch one another, ≈øo Chri≈øt would make the Angels and his Father beleeue, that his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies had not wounded his ≈øacred hands, but that his friends had done it as it were in ≈øporting. O how truly we may ≈øay with the Prophet <hi>Dauid, Non e≈øt deus no≈øter ≈øicut dijeorum,</hi> Our God is not like vnto their gods, ≈øeeing that here vpon earth men take in earne≈øt the words which their friends ≈øpeak in ie≈øt to them, and if they ≈øcratched with a pin, or with ones naile, they make no le≈ø≈øe a matter of it, than if it were a thru≈øt with a lance.

Reg. chap. 20. The≈øe holy words are rehear≈øed in ≈øcripture, talking of the friend≈øhip that was betwixt <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> and <hi>Ionathas:</hi> and this is their meaning; As king <hi>Dauid</hi> was departing out of the kingdome, and going from <hi>Ionathas</hi> his faithfull friend, at the time of their departure they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced one the other, and wept; and although <hi>Ionathas</hi> did weepe much, yet <hi>Dauid</hi> did weepe more. <hi>Mimus</hi> the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øopher ≈øayth, That the loue which one friend beareth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is neuer better knowne than when the one departeth from the other; for if the one want words, the other aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in teares. <hi>Cicero</hi> in his booke of Friend≈øhip ≈øayth, That true friend≈øhip is knowne in going the one from the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe that in their embracing the one the other, they change their hearts, in ≈øo much that this mans heart goeth away with him, and his heart remaineth with this man. It ≈øeemeth that <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Ionathas</hi> vvere great friends, ≈øeeing that they did embrace one another ≈øo heartily, and wept ≈øo tenderly. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> did much more e≈øteem of the friend≈øhip of <hi>Ionathas,</hi> than of the hatred of his father king <hi>Saul:</hi> the which was ea≈øily ≈øeene to bee ≈øo, con≈øidering that when <hi>Saul</hi> made a truce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, <hi>Dauid</hi> pre≈øently departed out of the kingdome. <hi>Dauid</hi> vvith all his wi≈øedome and force dur≈øt neuer abide the per≈øecution of <hi>Saul</hi> his enemie, vvithout his friend <hi>Ionathas</hi> aid: vvhereby vvee may inferre, that there is no griefe in this life equall to the lo≈ø≈øe of a friend. Bee hee (≈øaith <hi>Seneca</hi>) poore or be hee rich, be hee great or be hee little, how is it po≈øsible for him to liue without a friend? <hi>Horace</hi> ≈øayth, That if a man be in pro≈øperous e≈øtate, he hath need of one to giue him coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øell, if in meane to comfort him: for I haue heard (≈øayth he)
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:3666:134"/>my mai≈øter <hi>Menander</hi> ≈øay, that a fortunate man hath as great need of good coun≈øell to gouerne him≈øelfe by, as the needy man hath need of helpe to lift vp him≈øelfe by.

That Philo≈øopher thought it a greater po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty to want friends, than to want money: wherein hee had great rea≈øon, becau≈øe that in tribulation or ≈øickne≈ø≈øe, it doth ea≈øe a man better to ≈øee two or three friends at his beds head, than to haue his che≈øts &amp; coffers full of gold and ≈øiluer. There are many (≈øayth <hi>Vbertinus</hi>) vvhich are poor of money, &amp; not of friends, and others which are poore in friends and not in money, and there are ≈øome which are poore in the one and in the other, of which ≈øort Chri≈øt is the chiefe, ≈øeeing that on the cro≈ø≈øe, he had no man which vvould be≈øtow a cup of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vpon him, nor any one which would giue him one word of comfort. Chri≈øt complaineth of the Apo≈øtles becau≈øe they fled, complaineth of his parents becau≈øe they did hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues, complained on his acquaintance becau≈øe they did not ≈øticke vnto him, becau≈øe that in all the conflict of his pa≈øsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hee had no friend which followed him, no kin≈øman which defended him, nor acquaintance which backed him. Chri≈øt had (≈øayth <hi>Rabanus</hi>) very honourable and vertuous friends, and valerous acquaintance; but vvhen they ≈øaw him weake in ≈øtrength, and poore in wealth, all of them left him in his troubles, becau≈øe they vvould not bee the partakers
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:3666:135"/>of his daunger. Saint <hi>Barnard</hi> crieth out and ≈øayth, What meaneth this O good Ie≈øus, vvhat meaneth this? There vvanteth not one in Ieru≈øalem to defend <hi>Barrabas,</hi> and dooth there vvant one before <hi>Pilate</hi> to defend thee?

Is it not thinke you a greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a man to offer his owne fle≈øh, than that vvhich is born of his fle≈øh? <hi>Iephthe</hi> vvas very loath and grieued to offer his onely daughter, and it vvas a great corra≈øiue to the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters heart, to ≈øee her ≈øelfe ≈øacrificed by her owne Father: but in the end ≈øhee vvas more ioyfull and glad of the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vvhich her Father receaued again≈øt his enemies, than grieued that her owne life ≈øhould bee ≈øacrificed. O how vvell one my≈øtery doth an≈øwere vnto another! for vvhen the fle≈øh ≈øaid, Let this cup pa≈ø≈øe from mee, vvith the daughter of <hi>Iephthe</hi> hee vvas loath to die: but vvhen hee ≈øaid, Not as I vvill, but as thou vvilt, hee was glad to ≈øuffer: ≈øo that that ≈øacred fle≈øh vvas very vvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to bee ≈øacrificed, becau≈øe that the diuine Word ≈øhould obtaine victory ouer ≈øinnes. Doe≈øt thou not
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:3666:137"/>thinke my brother, that one my≈øtery doth very vvell an≈øwere another, and that one ≈øecret is very vvell compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vvith another, ≈øeeing that that virgine vvas ≈øacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for her fathers honour, and that diuine and ≈øacred fle≈øh al≈øo ≈øacrificed for the honour and glory of his father? <hi>Iepthe</hi> had a great reuenge ouer his enemies, but Chri≈øt a farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ouer ≈øinne: and yet it is to be noted, that by how much the greater tho≈øe two victories vvere, ≈øo much the more greater vvere the prices vvhich they vvere bought for, becau≈øe the one did co≈øt his daughters life, and the other his owne. What can be deerer than that vvhich doth co≈øt a mans life? <hi>Pellem pro pelle &amp; cuncta dabit home pro anima≈øua,</hi> ≈øaith <hi>Iob</hi> chapter 2. The Scripture maketh mention in <hi>Iob,</hi> that as there appeared before the iudgement of God many vvicked men, the deuill made one among them: for good men doe neuer a≈ø≈øemble them≈øelues to doe good, but Sathan is there al≈øo to doe them ≈øome hurt. Our Lord ≈øaid vnto Sathan, from vvhence doe≈øt thou come, and vvhither ha≈øt thou gone? To this Sathan an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered, I haue gone about all the earth, and vvalked through it, to ≈øee whether I could happen vpon any more that vvere mine. Our Lord replied, ha≈øt thou ≈øeene my good ≈øeruant and tru≈øty friend <hi>Iob,</hi> vnto vvhome no man on the earth may bee compared? And doe≈øt thou not know Sathan that <hi>Iob</hi> is a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, ≈øincere in condition, vpright in his con≈øcience, fearfull in that vvhich the law commandeth, vvithout malice, &amp; one vvho continueth till this day in his innocency? Thou ha≈øt ≈øtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me vp again≈øt him, that I ≈øhould kil his ≈øonnes, de≈øtroy his ≈øheepe and deere, and that his oxen ≈øhould be ≈øtolne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> him, and all his vvealth taken from him, and that I ≈øhould depriue him of all his honour. Sathan an≈øwered vnto this and ≈øaid, Know Lord, that a man vvill giue all his vvealth &amp; ≈øub≈øtance vvith condition to ≈øaue his life. <hi>Pellem pro pelle dabit hemo,</hi> that is, A man vvill giue al his ≈øheepe skins, &amp; all the cowes hides in the vvorld to keepe his owne fle≈øh. If thou vvilt trie Lord vvho thy friend <hi>Iob</hi> is, lay thy hand vpon his owne per≈øon, and fill his bodie with a lepro≈øie, and then thou ≈øhalt ≈øee, that hee
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:3666:137"/>will bee more grieued to ≈øee his body plagued, than to ≈øee his goods taken from him. This then was the rea≈øoning and dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue which pa≈ø≈øed betwixt God &amp; the diuell touching <hi>Iobs</hi> tentation: whereof we may inferre, how much more that is to be e≈øteemed which the ≈øonne of God offered, than <hi>Iephthes</hi> ≈øacrifice, becau≈øe the one offered his daughter, and the other his owne proper life. The victory which <hi>Iephthe</hi> had, was a co≈øtly victory vnto him, but Chri≈øts was more co≈øtly, becau≈øe that <hi>Iephthe</hi> did ouercome and liue, but the ≈øonne of God did ouercome and die, and there is no dearer victory in the world than that which is bought with the exchange of a mans pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per life. Although <hi>Iephthe</hi> did loue his onely daughter well, yet Chri≈øt did loue his precious fle≈øh better, becau≈øe it was vnited vnto the diuine e≈ølence, and therefore the better hee did loue it, the more was his griefe in lo≈øing it. <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> ≈øayth, That wi≈øe men doe loue their liues better than others of the vulgar people, becau≈øe they ≈øee them≈øelues more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary vnto the Commonwealth, and euery common good is to be preferred before a particular. And according vnto this ≈øaying of the Philo≈øopher, as the ≈øonne of God was wi≈øer than all men, and better than all men, ≈øo without doubt by ≈øo much the more he loued his life, by how much it was mo≈øt profitable to all men. Sathan ≈øaid well <hi>Pellem pro pelle dabit ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> A man will giue one skin for another. For if a man would haue asked the captaine <hi>Iephthe</hi> which of the≈øe two thinges he would rather haue done, either haue ≈øacrificed his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or his owne per≈øon, it is to bee thought that hee would rather haue ≈øacrificed his daughter twi≈øe, than his owne per≈øon once. <hi>Seneca</hi> in his booke of Clemency ≈øayth, That becau≈øe it is a naturall thing vnto vs to liue, and a dreadfull and fearefull thing to die, wee are much afraid of our owne death, and beare another mans ea≈øily. <hi>Theophilus</hi> ≈øaith, That it is much to be maruelled that Chri≈øt would die; but it is much more to bee wondered at, that hee would die with ≈øo good a will, becau≈øe that without augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his glory, yea rather dimini≈øhing it, hee offered him≈øelfe
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:3666:138"/>willingly vnto them, to the end that they ≈øhould take his life from him. The figure ≈øayth further, that <hi>Iephthes</hi> daughter, went two months weeping and wailing her virginity on tho≈øe ≈øolitary mountains, with other virgines and maids which bare her company. What was the meaning that that pare virgine, bemoned and bewailed her virginity, but onely that ≈øhee was ≈øorry that ≈øhee had not been married, and had a husband, and that ≈øhe had no children to mourne for her death, or inherite her goods? It ≈øeemeth to bee a di≈øhone≈øt matter for a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to weepe, and bewaile her owne virginity, if there were no other hidden ≈øence vnder this letter, becau≈øe that in ≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the more ob≈øcure a ≈øaying is, the more fuller it is of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtery. Wee haue already ≈øaid that Chri≈øts ≈øacred fle≈øh is figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by that tender virgine, and now wee ≈øay againe, that as <hi>Iephthes</hi> daughter bewailed her owne virginity, ≈øo did Chri≈øt likewi≈øe his: only it is to be noted, that there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt weeping and weeping, virginitie and virginity. The ≈øonne then doth complaine on his father ≈øaying, Why ha≈øt thou for≈øaken me: which he vttered becau≈øe hee had not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied his mo≈øt pure virginity and mo≈øt holy innocency as he de≈øired to doe: for as he was borne a virgine, a virgine hee died; and if hee came innocent into the world, with his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency hee returned vnto heauen againe. Let no man thinke that Chri≈øt bewailed and wept his virginity, becau≈øe hee did inuiolably keepe his mo≈øt holy fle≈øh: for if his mother did not lo≈øe it in bringing him into the world, neither could hee lo≈øe it by liuing in the world. The cha≈øtity which the ≈øcripture ≈øpeaketh of, and the virginity which Chri≈øt bewaileth with <hi>Iephthes</hi> daughter, is not the corruptible virginity, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, not the virginity of the body, but of the ≈øoule, the which doth make our Lord great with holy ≈øpeeches and diuine in≈øpirations; and therefore if hee bee great with the≈øe diuine in≈øpirations, he bringeth forth afterward holy workes. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> vpon tho≈øe wordes, <hi>De≈øpon≈øauit te mihi in fide</hi> ≈øayth, Spirituall and holy men haue as great need to marry their foules with Chri≈øt, as worldlings haue to ≈øeeke husbands
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:3666:138"/>for their daughters: and if I haue ≈øaid as great, now I ≈øay more need; becau≈øe a maid may bee ≈øaued without the company of a husband, but a ≈øoule cannot be ≈øaued vnle≈ø≈øe ≈øhe take Chri≈øt with her. S. <hi>Barnard</hi> ≈øayth, O how farre more higher is the ≈øpirituall matrimony, than the corporall! the one is betweene the wife and her husband, the other betwixt the ≈øoule and Chri≈øt; of the one come children, which ≈øometimes do breed griefe &amp; anger, of the other there do proceed workes which doe alwaies good. If <hi>Iephthes</hi> daughter doe weepe her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting out of this world a virgine, euen ≈øo doth Chri≈øt weepe and lament his virginitie, becau≈øe hee hath left no greater a ≈øpirituall po≈øteritie after him: for he would willingly haue left all the hearts in the world great with child with good &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous de≈øires, and all ≈øoules deliuered of good workes. When God ≈øaid by the Prophet <hi>E≈øayas, Numquid ego qui alijs gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationem tribue, ≈øterilis ere?</hi> That is, Shall I be barren my ≈øelfe and giue i≈ø≈øue vnto others? hee did not ≈øpeake this for any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øire which hee had to marry him≈øelfe with any woman, but for the great zeale which hee had to marry and couple him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe with our ≈øoules; becau≈øe that in all ages and all times the cha≈øtity of the body is a holy thing, and in all ages &amp; all times the barrenne≈ø≈øe of the ≈øoule is naught and di≈øcommendable. What doe≈øt thou weepe for then O good Ie≈øus, what doe≈øt thou weepe? I weepe my virginity with the daughter of <hi>Iephthe,</hi> becau≈øe I haue ≈øcar≈øe found any in all the world who will marry with my diuine grace, nor who will be great with child with my diuine in≈øpirations: and that which I mi≈ølike mo≈øt of all is, that if I begin to dally and make loue with any ≈øinfull ≈øoule, ≈øhe turneth her backe towards mee, and is ready to flie from mee. I bewaile my virginitie, becau≈øe that in three and thirty yeares which I haue liued in the world, with al the ≈øermons which I haue preached, and with all the dead which I haue rai≈øed vnto life, and with all the diuels which I haue ca≈øt out, and all the ≈øinnes which I haue forgiuen, it ≈øeemeth vnto mee that I haue made ≈ømall gaine, and done lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle good in re≈øpect of the paines which I haue taken.
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:3666:139"/>I bewaile my virginity, becau≈øe that being come in per≈øon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, hauing in≈øtructed all the people, ≈øhed my bloud, rent and torne my fle≈øh, lo≈øt my reputation, and be≈øtowed my life, yet I ≈øee now that there is ≈øcar≈øe any one found who would benefit him≈øelfe with my bloud, or who is thankful vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me for my benefites be≈øtowed vpon him. I bewaile my vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity, becau≈øe I haue found none to be≈øtow my virginity on, none to giue my innocency vnto, none to impart my patience vnto, none vnto whome I may communicate my charity, nor any one with whom I may leaue my humility in keeping: but if I came rich and adorned with vertues in the world, ≈øo I mu≈øt return rich again with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> to heauen. The figure which wee haue ≈øpoken of, ≈øaith further, that all the maids of Sion did meet in Ieru≈øalem to mourn and weep the death of <hi>Ieph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes</hi> daughter foure daies one after another, in the which they made great lamentations, ≈øo that no yeare did pa≈ø≈øe, in which this ≈øolemnity was not ob≈øerued. It is here to be noted, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there haue beene in the ≈øynagogue many per≈øonages, noble in bloud, valerous in warre, di≈øcreet in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, learned in all ≈øciences, and cleane and vn≈øpotted in life, yet it is not read of any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, that after they were dead and buried, were mourned for at any other time. Al the kings, Dukes, Patriarks, and Prophets were buried by their friends and kin≈øfolkes, and forgotten of them, excepted onely the daughter of <hi>Iephthe,</hi> for who≈øe death all the virgines and maids did mourne and weepe euery yeare once by a ≈øpeciall priuiledge. Wee ≈øpeake all this becau≈øe that if the daughters of Sion thought it conuenient to thinke vpon and weepe for the death of that virgine once euery yeare, ≈øhould it not bee greater rea≈øon that wee ≈øhould weepe for the death of Ie≈øus Chri≈øt euery houre and euery moment of an houre? Tho≈øe virgines did weepe for the death of that young virgine for no other rea≈øon but becau≈øe ≈øhe was young, beautifull and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ≈øo that they were induced to make that ≈øolemne lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation rather through compa≈øsion than rea≈øon. What other rea≈øon could there bee for that ≈øolemne yearely lamentation,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:3666:139"/>≈øeeing that the daughter of <hi>Iephthe</hi> died not for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, nor yet had in e≈øtimation for any rare vertue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the re≈øt? Iu≈øt occa≈øion and rea≈øon doth inuite vs to weep euery houre, and euery moment of an houre, for the death of Chri≈øt, con≈øidering that he died for the Commonwealth, and paied for our offence.

Although the ≈øinfull ≈øoule doth not remember the death of Chri≈øt, yet the holy church doth not forget nor omit to celebrate his death once at the end of euery year in the holy weeke.

S. <hi>Barnard</hi> ≈øpeaking of our dury to God ≈øayth, If thou wilt know what God hath made thee, looke vvhat he hath done for thee: for in thy mi≈øerable nature the vvorkes of his infinite benignity doe appeare. How much the ba≈øer thy God made him≈øelfe in humility, ≈øo much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he made thee in goodne≈ø≈øe, and how much the more viler
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:3666:149"/>hee made him≈øelfe for mee, ≈øo much the more familiar and like hee made me vnto him. Take heed then man, that thou be not prowd, ≈øeeing that thou art made of dirt, and ≈øee that thou bee not vnthankfull and vngratefull vnto God, ≈øeeing that thou art ≈øo neer coupled vnto him, becau≈øe an vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man was neuer plea≈øant nor acceptable vnto God. It is the part of a peruer≈øe mind, to ≈øeeke occa≈øions and ≈øhifts to excu≈øe him≈øelfe, &amp; not to be gratefull for the benefites which he hath receiued: the which kind of trea≈øon and naughtine≈ø≈øe is proper only vnto ≈øhamele≈ø≈øe men, and to ≈øuch as haue dead hearts, and as it were without a ≈øoule. Who is he who cannot be thankfull for a benefite receiued, but he who neuer knew to doe good vnto others? All this is S. <hi>Barnards</hi> ≈øpeech. <hi>Ca≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiodorus</hi> ≈øayth in an Epi≈øtle, That it is a hard matter to ≈øuffer, and not ea≈øie to di≈ø≈øemble, that a wi≈øe &amp; di≈øcreet man ≈øhould gather no fruit of his trauaile, but that hee ≈øhould rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue hurt from whence hee hoped for remedy, in ≈øo much that he ≈øuffereth hurt without an offence giuen, puni≈øhment without a fault, griefe without cau≈øe, paine without ≈øin, per≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution without an enemy. Naughty mens manners would bee much wor≈øe than they are, if there were none to cha≈øti≈øe vice and reward vertue. <hi>Lactantius</hi> ≈øayth, That which Imaruell at in men is, that if they bee ≈øicke they commend them≈øelues pre≈øently vnto God, if they haue warres they run to God, if they want water they aske it of God, if they bee mole≈øted with a plague, they turne to God, if they goe by ≈øea, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them≈øelues vnto God; but that which cannot bee ≈øpoken without griefe is, that after God hath deliuered them out of tho≈øe dangers, no man thinketh more of God. Do not thinke it (≈øayth <hi>Seneca</hi>) to bee a ≈ømall misfortune vnto thee, if by chance thou ha≈øt lighted vpon an vngratefull friend, becau≈øe that as a benefite or good turne is woont to make of a foe a friend, ≈øo the ≈øame benefite is wont to make an enemy of him who was thy friend. For it is the property of an vngratefull man, that the more that he is bounden vnto any man for any benefite receiued of him, the more he hateth him of whom
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:3666:150"/>he hath receiued it: and the wor≈øt of all is, that they would ≈øee him dead of whom they receiued it, and not be thankfull at all for it. Thou doe≈øt complaine, O my friend <hi>Lucilius,</hi> that thou ha≈øt fallen vpon more than an vngratefull man, and that of an old friend hee is become thy new enemy, and if thou woulde≈øt enter into the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øideration of this lo≈ø≈øe, thou ≈øhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de≈øt ab≈øtaine from euer doing any good turn vnto any: which I doe not coun≈øell thee to doe, nor yet that thou coun≈øell any man to doe it, becau≈øe it is better that men accu≈øe the other of vngratefulne≈ø≈øe, than thy ≈øelfe of couetou≈øne≈ø≈øe, and that the benefite bee lo≈øt in the other, rather than rot in thee. There is no vice more common among men, than for one man to be vngratefull vnto another, which doth proceed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, hereof, that men know not how to make choice of their friends, or for that they doe not be≈øtow their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites well: and therefore oftentimes we haue greater rea≈øon to complaine vpon our ≈øelues, for not knowing how to giue, rather than of others, becau≈øe they bee vngratefull for the good turnes which they haue receiued of vs. <hi>Cicero</hi> in his third booke of laws ≈øayth, <hi>Clari≈øsimi viri Athenis pul≈øi carere ingrata ciuitate maluerunt, qu√†m manere in improba,</hi> as if hee would ≈øay, Many famous men in watres, and learned in ≈øcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, haue been bani≈øhed from Athens, not for any fault which they committed, but for malice conceiued again≈øt them; the which were rather willing and glad to liue in bani≈øhment than to dwell in an vngratefull citie. <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> ≈øayth, That the mo≈øt notable≈øt man that the renowmed Lacedemonia did euer bring forth, was that great Philo≈øopher <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> becau≈øe among all tho≈øe which liued before his time, &amp; tho≈øe which ≈øucceeded him, there was none equall vnto him in knowledge, nor none which went beyond him in life. The O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of <hi>Pithius Apollo,</hi> being asked in what reputation he did hold <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> made an≈øwere, I am very doubtfull vvhether I ≈øhould put him among the number of men, or place him among the companie of Gods. Notwith≈øtanding that the Oracle had giuen this high te≈øtimony of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> and that
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:3666:150"/>he was pure in his life, eloquent in learning, con≈øtant in paines, and very wi≈øe in his lawes, yet all the≈øe vertues and excellent gifts could not keepe him from proouing the vngratefulne≈ø≈øe of his thankle≈ø≈øe citizens. And therefore they did not onely iniury him in words, but al≈øo they did ≈øhew by cruell deeds the hatred which they bare him, and the hurt which they wi≈øhed him: for once they burned his hou≈øes, and another time they followed him with ≈øtones, and another time they da≈øhed out one of his eies, another time they expelled him from among the people, and in the end for a recompence and reward of gouerning that Commonwealth eight and thirtie years, they bani≈øhed him out of the country, and ≈øo hee died. <hi>Plautus</hi> ≈øayth, That there is no loue wor≈øe be≈øtowed than that which is be≈øtowed vpon an vngrateful man, becau≈øe that man loueth nothing at all who loueth an vngratefull man. I haue ≈øpoken all this again≈øt the vice of vngratitude, and v≈øed ≈øo many examples, becau≈øe euery man might perceiue what great rea≈øon God hath to complaine vpon vngratefull men: for ≈øeeing that the Philo≈øophers doe inueigh ≈øo bitterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt them, it would be but ≈ømall rea≈øon that they ≈øhould be defended by Chri≈øtians. S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ≈øayth, Chri≈øt doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of our ingratitude, becau≈øe that for ≈øo great &amp; vn≈øpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a benefite as he did for vs in dying vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, hee did not bind vs to follow him in that kind of death, or that we ≈øhould die for him by the ≈øword, but that which good Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus did bind vs vnto is, that we ≈øhould haue his ble≈ø≈øed pa≈øsion in a remembrance, and loue him with all our heart. How ≈øhall any man (≈øayth <hi>Barnard</hi>) beleeue that thou wilt venter thy life for Chri≈øt, and for his faith, ≈øeeing thou doe≈øt not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his death in all thy life? If thou wilt (≈øayth <hi>Vbertinus</hi>) haue the death of Chri≈øt help thee in thy la≈øt houre, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that death of his euery day; becau≈øe the ≈øonne of God doth alwaies take pittie vpon tho≈øe in their la≈øt houre, vvhich doe remember his pa≈øsion in their life time. Chri≈øt ≈øaith, And my griefe is alwaies before my eies, becau≈øe that among all the griefes which are, ingratitude is cau≈øe of
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:3666:151"/>the greate≈øt of them, and among all the ≈øinnes and naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe which are, this is the greate≈øt: for if there were no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull men vnto God, there ≈øhould bee no ≈øinne at all in the world. Chri≈øt doth cal the ≈øinne of vngratefulne≈ø≈øe dolour and griefe, becau≈øe that hee is alwaies grieued with it: for the griefe which hee had of the thornes is pa≈øt, his whipping had an end, and the paine of the cro≈ø≈øe dured no longer than his life did la≈øt, but the griefe of ingratitude is renued in him dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Chri≈øt doth al≈øo ≈øay, that the griefe which hee doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of is his owne griefe, <hi>Dolor meus:</hi> by which louing ≈øpeech he doth let vs vnder≈øtand, that he is much more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to ≈øee vs ≈øinne, than it grieueth vs to be ≈øinners. Why doth Chri≈øt ≈øay in his complaint, my griefe, and not our griefe but onely becau≈øe that wee doe not feele ≈øo great paine and griefe when we are puni≈øhed by him, as good Ie≈øus feeleth to thinke that he mu≈øt puni≈øh vs. I would to God that it would plea≈øe his diuine clemency, that I were ≈øo ≈øory to commit an offence, as it doth grieue him to puni≈øh me: for then I thinke that I ≈øhould not know how to ≈øinne, nor God ≈øhould haue nothing to puni≈øh. He complaineth al≈øo that he doth not only ≈øuffer griefe, but he ≈øayth that that grief is alwaies in his ≈øight; and therefore becau≈øe wee doe neuer giue ouer ≈øinning, it is certaine, that his griefe of compa≈øsion wil neuer haue an end. Cea≈øe then my brother, and giue ouer ≈øinning, and then the paine which thou doe≈øt endure, will pre≈øently haue an end. When thou ≈øhalt heare vs ≈øay that God hath any griefe or paine, thou mu≈øt not thinke that it is a griefe or paine which hee ≈øuffereth, but onely a mo≈øt entire and louing compa≈øsion which he hath vpon vs. When the ≈øonne of God ≈øayth vpon the cro≈ø≈øe vnto his Father, Why ha≈øt thou for≈øaken mee, the chiefe≈øt complaint that hee formeth in that place is, becau≈øe hee cau≈øeth him to ≈øuffer ≈øo cruell a pa≈øsion for ≈øuch vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full people.</p>

God then calleth the hou≈øe of <hi>Iacob,</hi> which is the church, calleth tho≈øe which remained of the hou≈øe of I≈ørael, which is the Synagogue, becau≈øe Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was the re≈øidue of I≈ørael, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was the re≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of I≈ørael, and all tho≈øe of his Colledge were the remnant of I≈ørael, the which the ≈øonne of God vvent throughout all the Iewi≈øh nation to gather together as it had been crummes of bread hurled abroad.

The Scripture declaring the great hatred which <hi>Iacobs</hi> eleuen ≈øons bare vnto their brother <hi>Io≈øeph,</hi> ≈øpeaketh the≈øe words: and the meaning is this, The elder brothers did hate the yong very much, becau≈øe his father did loue him be≈øt, and make mo≈øt of him; and their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and enuy grew to that depth, that they could not endure to ≈øee him, nor ≈øpeake one friendly word vnto him. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> thought that enuy was the root and foundation of the perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mankind, ≈øeeing hee ≈øayth, that <hi>Propter inuidiam mors intrauit in mundum:</hi> and therefore it ≈øhall be great rea≈øon that we declare what enuie is, and what hurt it doth, and who is Queene of enuy. <hi>Ari≈øtotle</hi> ≈øayth, That enuy is nothing el≈øe but a pa≈øsion of the mind, &amp; a mortall angui≈øh to ≈øee another man in credite and honour, imagining that to be his di≈øcredit. <hi>Horace</hi> ≈øayth, The greate≈øt griefe that we haue with enuy is, that it is not in the eies, for ≈øo it would bee ≈øeene, nor in the hands, for it would bee felt, nor in the tongue, for it would bee heard, but his chaire and ≈øeat is in the ≈øecrete≈øt place of the heart and mind, where it abideth, complaining of euery man, and tormenting him who po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øeth it. <hi>Menander</hi> ≈øaith, The mother of enuie is ≈øwelling pride, and cur≈øed ambition, and therefore they neuer goe a≈øunder, or very ≈øeldome, but where pride is there is enuy, and where enuy, there pride. S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> ≈øayth, Take away enuy, and pre≈øently all that is mine, is thine, and all that is thine is mine. <hi>Origen</hi> ≈øayth, Enuy doth grow ≈øo fa≈øt vpon me by rea≈øon of the di≈øordinate loue which I beare vnto my owne per≈øon: for thereby I beare malice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my inferiors for feare lea≈øt they become my equals, and I enuy my equals lea≈øt they goe beyond mee, and I ≈øpight my ≈øuperiors becau≈øe they doe me no good. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> in a Sermon ≈øayth, That the difference betwixt a malicious man, and an enuious man is, that the malicious man doth loue nothing but that that is naught, and the enuious man doth hate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:3666:159"/>but that which is good. S. <hi>Gregory</hi> in the fift booke of his Morals ≈øayth, The naughty man doth enuy none but ≈øuch as he ≈øeeth in higher e≈øtate than him≈øelfe, or whom hee ≈øeeth to bee of better life than him≈øelfe, or whome hee heareth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ≈øpoken off than him≈øelfe: whereof it in≈øueth, that how much the other doth grow &amp; encrea≈øe in goodne≈ø≈øe, ≈øo much the enuious man doth vexe and torment him≈øelfe. <hi>I≈øidorus</hi> ≈øayth, Take heed of enuy, my brother, take heed; for it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing el≈øe but a certaine di≈øea≈øe which doth trouble thy ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, burneth thy brea≈øt, gnaweth thy bowels, grindeth thy heart, wa≈øteth thy life, darkeneth thy memory, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth thy ≈øoule. <hi>Seneca</hi> ≈øayth, That a man doth ≈øeldome enuy him whom he can ouercome, but him whom he cannot van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui≈øh. And the ≈øelfe≈øame <hi>Seneca</hi> ≈øayth further, It is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for vs to beware of the enuy of our friends, than of the hatred and di≈øplea≈øure of our enemies, becau≈øe the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my carrieth his hatred in his tongue, and I take heed of him: but becau≈øe my friend hideth his enuy in his heart, it cannot be known, nor I cannot beware of him. <hi>Laertius</hi> ≈øaith, I would to God, that all enuious men had their eies ≈øcattered ouer all the world, that becau≈øe other mens goods and welfare is a torment vnto them, they might bee tormented with ≈øo many tortures, as they ≈øee other mens hap and felicity encrea≈øe. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> ≈øayth, There hath no man liued in this world in fame and credite, but hee hath pre≈øently felt the worme of enuy; whereof it followeth, that the poor and mi≈øerable man doth only e≈øcape the enuious mans hands. <hi>Demosthenes</hi> in an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ≈øayth, What ≈øhall I doe wretched man as I am, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øhall I goe? For if I de≈øire to liue in pouerty, mi≈øery doth weary me; and if I chu≈øe to be rich, enuie doth torment mee. To come then vnto our purpo≈øe, all this di≈øcour≈øe hath ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto no other end, but to admoni≈øh all men of hone≈øt life, and of a cleane con≈øcience; to beware of enny, becau≈øe the Deuill is ≈øuch a friend vnto this vice, that if hee ≈øee a man to bee very enuious, hee will tempt him with no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øinne. <hi>Cicero</hi> ≈øayth, What hath cau≈øed all the vvarres

Although Chri≈øt vvas poore, yet hee vvas hated of the vvicked, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed of malice, and per≈øecuted vvith enuy. But his pouertie being ≈øo great as it was, and hiding his power as he did, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ≈øhould any man enuie him? They did not enuy Chri≈øt for the feature of his body, ≈øeeing there vvere other beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full al≈øo, nor for his ≈øtocke and kindred, ≈øeeing there vvere others noble al≈øo; not for his eloquence, ≈øeeing there were others learned, nor for his vvealth, ≈øeeing there vvere o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more vvealthy; but that vvhich they did mo≈øt of all enuy at vvas, his Catholicke doctrine vvhich hee did preach, and holy life which hee did lead, becau≈øe that none of the Prophets vvhich vvent before him, did preach of ≈øuch high points as hee did, nor yet any one of them did liue ≈øo ≈øincerely as hee did. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> vpon tho≈øe words, <hi>Sciebat enim quod per inuidiam tradidi≈ø≈øent eum</hi> ≈øayth, The enuy conceiued again≈øt good life, is more dangerous than that vvhich is bred by rea≈øon of our vvealth: for if hee bee a naughtie man vvhich is po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of this vvealth, hee vvill endeuour him≈øelfe rather to encrea≈øe his ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, than amend his life. Let vs compare then the enuie vvhich <hi>Iacobs</hi> ≈øonnes bare vnto their brother <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeph,</hi> vvith the enuie vvhich they did beare vnto Chri≈øt, and vvee ≈øhall ≈øee how vvell the figure dooth an≈øwere vnto the thing figured, and the ≈øpirit vnto the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ≈øeeing that the one vvas fold by enuie into Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt, and the other al≈øo through enuie crucified. <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeph</hi> did mi≈ølike his brothers doings, and therefore they did enuie him; and Chri≈øt did not like the Iewes do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and therefore they did hate him: and they did per≈øecute <hi>Io≈øeph</hi> becau≈øe hee did accu≈øe them before their father; and enuied Chri≈øt becau≈øe hee did reprehend them before the people. The Iewes malice towards Chri≈øt vvas greater than <hi>Io≈øephs</hi> brothers again≈øt him; for <hi>Io≈øeph</hi>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:3666:160"/>was onely ≈øold, but innocent Ie≈øus was not onely ≈øold, but al≈øo crucified. <hi>Io≈øephs</hi> brothers could not giue him one faire word, neither could the Iewes hear Chri≈øts doctrine with patience: and therefore if his diuine prouidence ≈øhould not haue kept him from their fury, they had taken Chri≈øts life long before away from him. <hi>Nolunt audire te, quiae nolunt audire me filij ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis, quia omnis I≈ørael e≈øt attrita fronte, &amp; duro corde,</hi> ≈øaid God vnto the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel:</hi> as if hee ≈øhould ≈øay, Bee not angry O <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> bee not angry, if thou perceiue that thou doe≈øt no good with thy ≈øpeech, and ha≈øt no credite among them: for ≈øeeing that they doe not beleeue me, it is not to bee maruelled though they doe not heare thee: for the hou≈øe of I≈ørael is growne now vnto that madne≈ø≈øe, that it hath neither con≈øcience in her ≈øoule, nor ≈øhame in her face. The≈øe are the words of the eternall Father, directed vnto his ble≈ø≈øed ≈øon, letting him vnder≈øtand by them what ≈ømall fruit hee ≈øhould reape by his doctrine, and what ≈ømal credite they would giue vnto his ≈øpeech; &amp; the rea≈øon is, becau≈øe that all tho≈øe which were of the hou≈øe of I≈ørael were inwardly without a good ≈øpirit, and outwardly without ≈øhame. According vnto this ≈øpeech of the Prophet ≈øuch Prelates as gouern &amp; preach, do toile &amp; labor exceedingly, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the ≈øubiects which heare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, are a people without any con≈øcience, &amp; of le≈ø≈øe ≈øhame. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides that they do no good among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, there is al≈øo great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to liue among them. <hi>Ezechiel</hi> did very well couple ≈ømall con≈øcience with ≈ømall ≈øhame, and ≈ømall ≈øhame with a ≈ømall con≈øcience, becau≈øe that you ≈øhall neuer or very ≈øildome ≈øee a ≈øhamele≈ø≈øe man, but hee is without con≈øcience, nor a man without con≈øcience but is al≈øo ≈øhamele≈ø≈øe. Wickedne≈ø≈øe for wickedne≈ø≈øe, and ≈øinne for ≈øin, A Chri≈øtian can haue no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ≈øinnes than to bee ob≈øtinate in heart, and without ≈øhame in his face, becau≈øe that hell is full of none but of ≈øuch as are of an ob≈øtinate heart and impudent countenance. The man which is of a tender and ≈øoft heart, and ≈øhamefa≈øt in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, is ea≈øily amended, and doth now and then ≈øinne by ≈øtealth; but he who is hard harted &amp; ≈øhamele≈ø≈øe in condition,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:3666:160"/>doth late or neuer amend his ≈øinne, becau≈øe he careth not for being counted a ≈øinner. When Chri≈øt ≈øaid, <hi>Gaudete &amp; exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, quia nomina ve≈øtra ≈øcripta ≈øunt in caelis,</hi> he gaue vs heence to be glad of nothing, but only that we were good Chri≈øtians, and regi≈øtred in the booke of Saints; and likewi≈øe that wee ≈øhould be ≈øorry of nothing ≈øo much, as to be naughty Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and blotted out of the booke of life: for he was borne in an euill houre, who doth not endeuour to amend his life, and doth not care at all to ≈øinne. We ≈øpeake all this to proue that the Iewes vvere of a ≈øhamele≈ø≈øe forehead and hard hearted, ≈øeeing that <hi>Pilate</hi> did know plainely, that they did accu≈øe Chri≈øt through enuy and malice, which hee gathered by the ≈øhamele≈ø≈øe ≈øpeeches which they v≈øed again≈øt Chri≈øt, and the fal≈øe proofes which they alledged again≈øt him. <hi>Facta e≈øt fames magna in Samaria, ita vt caput a≈øini vaenundaretur octoginta ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genteis,</hi> 4 Reg. 6. The Scripture rehear≈øeth this, to ≈øhew the great mi≈øery and di≈øtre≈ø≈øe that Samaria was in, as if it would ≈øay, When Samaria vvas at warres with the Arabians, being be≈øieged and afflicted with famine, an a≈ø≈øe head vvas worth foure≈øcore rials, and a certaine mea≈øure of Pigeons dung fiue rials, ≈øo that they had no meat to eat but a≈ø≈øes, and nothing to dre≈ø≈øe it with but Pigeons dung. Although the fle≈øh of an a≈ø≈øe bee loth≈øome to eat, and Pigeons dung filthy to burne, yet notwith≈øtanding vvee vvill draw ≈øome my≈øtery of this figure, to aduance Chri≈øts honour by it, becau≈øe there is no word in holy Scripture which hath not ≈øome ≈øecret hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vnder it. In this figure of the a≈ø≈øe is repre≈øented the great warre that Chri≈øt found in mans nature. What other thing was the warre vvhich Samaria had vvith the king of Arabia, but the di≈øplea≈øure &amp; anger which God had again≈øt the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue? What was the great dearth &amp; famine which they endured, but the exceeding want which they had of good doctrine? What did it meane that an a≈ø≈øes head was ≈øold ≈øo deerly, but only that a good man was little worth, &amp; a naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty man highly e≈øteemed? By the Pigeons dung wherewith they did dre≈ø≈øe the a≈ø≈øes head, is meant nothing el≈øe but the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:3666:161"/>Mo≈øaicall ceremonies with the which they did offer vp their ≈øacrifices. There fell nothing vnto the Synagogues lot but the dregs, and the wine vnto the church; to the Synagogue the barke, and vnto the church the fruit; the thorne vnto the Synagogue, and the ro≈øe vnto the church; the Pigeons dung to the Synagogue, and to vs the Pigeon. The warre betwixt God and mans nature, was farre more cruell, than that which was betwixt the city of Samaria and the king of Arabia, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe men did nothing but ≈øight with God with their ≈øinnes, and God did nothing vnto man but inflict puni≈øhment vpon him. If they aske the ≈øonne of God why hee came into this world, and took humane fle≈øh vpon him, he will an≈øwer them, that his comming was to relieue this famine, and appea≈øe this warre, in te≈øtimony whereof the Angels in heauen did ≈øing, when Chri≈øt was borne, Peace, Peace; ≈øeeing that I am a meane between you, there mu≈øt be no more anger left. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the ≈øonne of God came into the world, the warre cea≈øed, and when he began to preach, the famine began to cea≈øe, becau≈øe that this famine, which humane nature was afflicted with, was not cau≈øed for want of corporall food, but for want of vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>. The want of victuals dured in Samaria but the ≈øpace of one yeare, but the want of vertuous men continued in the Synagogue from the time of the valerous Machabeans vntill the comming of Chri≈øt: for from that time vntill Chri≈øts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, they had no Prophet to giue them light, no captaine to defend them, no Prie≈øt to teach them, nor any other famous man to reioice in. Who did euer find a greater dearth in the world than that which Chri≈øt found among the Iewes? See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he found the princely ≈øcepter broken, the prie≈øthood at an end, the Temple robbed, the city peruerted, and her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie lo≈øt? There was a great dearth in the Synagogue, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidering that there was not in her one per≈øon of account. For he did not chu≈øe the twelue Apo≈øtles for his companions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they were holy, but becau≈øe hee meant to make them holy. There was a great famine in Samaria, ≈øeeing the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was <hi>Pilate,</hi> who was a Tyrant, the bi≈øhop was <hi>Cayphas,</hi>
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:3666:161"/>who was a prophane per≈øon, the Phari≈øies were coun≈øellers, who were Hypocrites, the Preachers were Sadduces, who were Heretikes, and their gouernours were Romanes, who were Gentiles and Pagans. How was it po≈øsible that there ≈øhould bee any good in a Commonwealth, which was gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ≈øuch naughty gouernours? As in the vnfortunate Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria they had no kine nor calues left, ≈øo al≈øo the Synagogues Patriarkes and Prophets were at an end, and that which was wor≈øt of all was, that as Samaria was con≈øtrained to feed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a≈ø≈øes heads, ≈øo the Synagogue was forced to bee gouerned by naughty and wicked men. Wee doe not ≈øay much in ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they were gouerned by wicked men: for wee might with good rea≈øon call them a≈ø≈øes, ≈øeeing they had no di≈øcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to know that vvhich was good, nor wi≈øedome to e≈øchew that vvhich vvas naught. Doe≈øt thou not thinke that <hi>Pilate</hi> the iudge vvas a very a≈ø≈øe, ≈øeeing hee confe≈ø≈øed before them all, that hee found no cau≈øe to put Chri≈øt to death, and yet <hi>Tradidit illum voluntati eorum?</hi> Thou doe≈øt confe≈ø≈øe, <hi>Pilate,</hi> that Chri≈øt was vvithout fault: and yet doe≈øt thou condemne him to die? Was not the High-prie≈øt <hi>Cayphas</hi> a very a≈ø≈øe, to ≈øay that Chri≈øt bla≈øphemed, becau≈øe hee ≈øaid that hee would come to iudge the vvorld? Art thou iudge of the vvorld which is not thine, and vvilt thou not let him iudge the vvorld vvho hath created it? Was not, thinke≈øt thou, King <hi>Herod</hi> a great a≈ø≈øe for clothing Chri≈øt in fooles apparrell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe Chri≈øt vvould not giue him an an≈øwere, ≈øeeing that for that act hee ≈øhould rather haue accounted him wi≈øe than otherwi≈øe? Wherein could the ≈øonne of God haue better ≈øhowne his di≈øcretion and patience, than in not an≈øwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vnto any iniury, and in not mi≈øgouerning him≈øelfe in any word? Was not all the vvhole congregation and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øell of the Iewes, a very a≈ø≈øe in thy opinion, in that they did crie for libertie for <hi>Barrabas,</hi> and procured that Chri≈øt ≈øhould die? The Synagogue did not buy <hi>Barrabas</hi> life ≈øo good cheape, as Samaria did the a≈ø≈øes head, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the a≈ø≈øes head was bought for money, but <hi>Barrabas</hi> life
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:3666:162"/>did co≈øt Chri≈øt his bloud. It was not worth ≈øo much, and yet they gaue more in Samaria for an a≈ø≈øes head, than they did for Chri≈øts bloud in Ieru≈øalem, ≈øeeing they gaue but thirty pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of money for Chri≈øt, and foure≈øcore for the a≈ø≈øes head. To ≈øpeake morally then; men buy the a≈ø≈øes head deerely, when they chu≈øe for the gouernour of a Commonwealth, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, a ≈øimple and vndi≈øcreet man; becau≈øe that in all canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call elections, the learned is to bee preferred before the ≈øim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the wi≈øe before the vndi≈øcreet. There mu≈øt needs be a great famine in that mona≈øtery, in which they chu≈øe for their head, ≈øuch a one as is light in behauiour, ba≈øe in linage, a foole in his iudgement, &amp; an a≈ø≈øe in his con≈øcience. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet did not ≈øay in vaine, <hi>Cum ≈øancto ≈øanctus eris, &amp; cum peruer≈øo peruerteris;</hi> For a wi≈øe man can bring vp but wi≈øe men, a wicked man nothing but wicked men, and an a≈ø≈øe none but a≈ø≈øes. O thou who≈øoeuer thou art who doe≈øt hear or read this, doe not thinke that we call tho≈øe a≈ø≈øes who haue but ≈ømall or no learning, but tho≈øe which haue no con≈øcience, nor no brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vp: for he is often fitter to gouern who hath great experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence &amp; di≈øcretion, than hee who is full of knowledge &amp; folly.

That two children haue been borne at one birth wee haue ≈øeene often, and that one ≈øhould be borne before the other we haue al≈øo heard: but that the one ≈øhould haue his finger tied and not the other, is a thing that hath neuer been ≈øeene nor hard of; and therefore by how much the thing is more rare, by ≈øo much it is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of my≈øtery and ≈øecret. Deepely then expounding this ≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, who were the two children born at one birth, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the humane &amp; diuine nature, which ≈øaued the world? The two children who≈øe names were <hi>Phares</hi> and <hi>Zaram</hi> did know no other mother but <hi>Thamar,</hi> and the diuine and humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did acknowledge no other father but God: for as it is an ea≈øie matter for a father to haue many childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, ≈øo it is a hard &amp; impo≈øsible thing for Chri≈øt to haue many fathers. Although tho≈øe two children were very naturall, and neere brothers the one to the other, and of one belly, yet they were neuer ≈øov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited together, as the diuine and humane nature was vnited in Chri≈øt, becau≈øe the≈øe two were neuer ≈øeperated in Chri≈øt in his life, nor ≈øeuered at his death vpon the cro≈ø≈øe.

What did it mean that the other brother was born with a coloured thred tied about his finger, but that Chri≈øt ≈øhould ≈øhed his bloud for the redemption of all the world? O good Ie≈øus, O redemption of my ≈øoule! thou doe≈øt ≈øee well, that to come out of thy mothers wombe with thy finger tied, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing el≈øe but to come into the world condemned to death. <hi>Zaram</hi> onely, who was the figure, and the ≈øonne of God, who was the thing figured, were tho≈øe who had their finger tied with a coloured thred, becau≈øe he and no other was to die for the world, and redeeme vs out of ≈øinne.

The difference betwixt thee, O my ≈øweet Ie≈øus, and other condemned per≈øons is this, that they are tied in a hempen cord, and thou in a thred of ≈øcarlet, and they about the necke, and thou about the finger, and they are lead to be hanged, and thou to be crucified. A thiefe is led away bound with a great tope, becau≈øe he is drawne to death by force, but the ≈øonne of God is tied with a ≈ømall fine thred, becau≈øe hee dieth not by force, but of his owne free will: for if it were not his good plea≈øure ≈øo to doe, neither the Angels, nor men, nor the diuels were able to put him to death. O high my≈øtery, O diuine Sacrament! who euer ≈øaw or heard, that before a child were borne, or knew what ≈øinne was, yet that he ≈øhould come out of his mothers wombe already condemned? What mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy can be compared vnto this, that before his mother ≈øhould giue him milke to ≈øucke, his owne father threatened him that he ≈øhould die crucified? <hi>Elegit ≈øu≈øpendium anima mea, &amp; o≈ø≈øa mea mortem, &amp; nequaquam vltra iam viuam,</hi> ≈øaith <hi>Iob</hi> chap. 7.

<pb n="326" facs="tcp:3666:166"/>that hee ≈øhould haue defended him, it ≈øeemeth a very hard part to ≈øuffer him to bee crucified. The ≈øonne of God dooth frame two great complaints in the≈øe wordes, the one of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Father, the other of him≈øelfe: and therefore it is very conuenient that we declare how the eternall Father did ≈øend his ≈øonne to die, and how hee him≈øelfe went to ≈øuffer on the cro≈ø≈øe: and in ≈øo doing, wee ≈øhall find that the one did that which hee did, moued therevnto with charity, and the other to ≈øuffer that which hee ≈øuffered, was mooued with pitty. <hi>Qui proprio filio non pepercis, ≈øed pro omnibus nobistradidit illum,</hi> ≈øaith S. <hi>Paul:</hi> and his meaning is this, The loue which God bare vnto all the world, was ≈øo exceeding great, that he would not pardon the death of his owne proper ≈øonne, but would haue him crucified for all.

                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Actus ≈øum mihimet ip≈øi grauis,</hi> ≈øayth <hi>Iob,</hi> as we haue already ≈øaid. Although ≈øaith hee, I complaine of many, yet I complaine of none more than of my ≈øelfe; and although many things doe wage battaile again≈øt me, yet I am the greate≈øt enemy vnto my ≈øelfe. <hi>Origen</hi> vpon this place ≈øayth, It is a thing neuer heard of, and a very ≈øtrange complaint: for although a man bee neuer ≈øo culpable, yet he de≈øireth to excu≈øe him≈øelfe, and accu≈øe others. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in a Sermon ≈øayth, We fall euery day and ≈øtumble, and ≈øinne: yet notwith≈øtanding all the≈øe faults, no man dooth confe≈ø≈øe him≈øelfe to bee naught, nor acknowledge his brother to bee good. <hi>Petrarch</hi> ≈øayth, That men complaine of the ≈øea, that it is dangerous, of the aire that it is corrupt, of his friend that he is a di≈ø≈øembler, of the time that it is trouble≈øome; and yet I ≈øee no man (≈øayth he) who complaineth of him≈øelfe: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee are like vnto young game≈øters, which neuer blame
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:3666:168"/>their owne play, but when they loo≈øe do cur≈øe the dice. This ≈øpeech of <hi>Iob</hi> doth containe much matter, and therefore it is conuenient that wee tell you how many ≈øorts of warre there is, ≈øeeing he ≈øaith, that he maketh war again≈øt him≈øelfe. There is therefore one kind of vvarre which is called a roiall warre, another called ciuill warre, another more than ciuill vvarre, another per≈øonall, and another cordiall or of the heart. Of all which warres I will tell you what we haue read, and what we thinke. It is called a royall war, becau≈øe it is made by one king again≈øt another, or by one kingdome again≈øt another: as the warre betwixt <hi>Darius</hi> and <hi>Alexander, Troianus</hi> and <hi>Decebalus,</hi> Rome and Carthage, the which two prowd cities, although they had no kings, yet they were heads of kingdomes. There is another kind of warre called ciuill warre, which is betwixt neighbour and neighbour, or when a cittie deuideth it ≈øelfe, and fighteth the one again≈øt the other; as in Carthage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Hannones</hi> and <hi>Ha≈ødrubales,</hi> and in Rome betwixt <hi>Scilla</hi> and <hi>Marius,</hi> and afterward betwixt <hi>Cae≈øar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> all which ended their liues before they ended their quarrell. There is another warre called more than ciuill warre, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ≈øonne and the father, brother and brother, vncle and cou≈øin; as betwixt <hi>Dauid</hi> and his ≈øonne <hi>Ab≈øalon,</hi> who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed to take away the kingdome from his father, although hee atchieued not his enterpri≈øe, but in the end was hanged vpon an oke. It was more than a ciuill warre that was betwixt the <hi>Aiaces</hi> the Greekes, <hi>Bries</hi> the Licaonians, <hi>Athenones</hi> the Troians, <hi>Fabritioes</hi> the Romanes. This is the mo≈øt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous kind of warre that is, becau≈øe tho≈øe hatreds which are conceiued betwixt kin≈ømen, by ≈øo much the more are more deadly, by how much they are neerer tied in kindred. There is another kind of war which is called per≈øonall or a combat, vvhen two valiant men doe fight a combate for the auerring of ≈øome vveighty and important affaire, vvhere for to ≈øaue their honour they loo≈øe ≈øometime their life and honour both. This kind of combate the valiant <hi>Dauid</hi> fought again≈øt the Giant <hi>Golias,</hi> the one armed and the
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:3666:168"/>other vvithout armes: yet in the end <hi>Dauid</hi> did ouercome <hi>Golias</hi> and killed him with his ≈øling, and cut off his head vvith his owne ≈øword. There is another kind of vvarre more ≈øtranger than tho≈øe vvee haue ≈øpoken of, vvhich is called the vvarre of the heart or entrals, which is begun in the heart, fought in the heart, and al≈øo ended in the heart. In this ≈øorrowfull vvarre, ≈øighes are the darts they ca≈øt, tears the weapons they fight with, the bowels the field vvhere the battaile is fought, and tho≈øe vvho fight are the hearts, and he who can weepe be≈øt, is accounted the be≈øt ≈øouldiour. <hi>Factus ≈øum mihimet ip≈øi grauis,</hi> becau≈øe there, there fighteth one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the other, and both again≈øt him, loue and feare, ≈ølouth and courage, talking and ≈øilence, anger and patience. O what great rea≈øon <hi>Iob</hi> had to ≈øay, <hi>Factus ≈øum mihimet ip≈øi grauis,</hi> ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that not in the corners, but in the very midde≈øt of our hearts, theft and almes deeds doe fight and ≈øtriue the one again≈øt the other. And rea≈øon and ≈øen≈øuality, care and ≈øluggi≈øhne≈ø≈øe, ≈øtrife and quietne≈ø≈øe, anger and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, couetou≈øne≈ø≈øe and liberality, pardon and reuenge. O vnhappy battaile and dangerous combate, vvhere I am made <hi>Mihimet ip≈øi grauis,</hi> ≈øeeing vvee fight heere not in company, but alone, not openly but ≈øecretly, not vvith ≈øwords but vvith thoughts, and there is nothing ≈øeene but all is felt. And that vvhich is vvor≈øt of all is, that to ouercome vvee mu≈øt ≈øometimes ≈øuffer our ≈øelues to bee ouercome. Where but in this more than ciuill vvarre, in vvhat fight but in this, in vvhat ≈øtrife but in this, did all the holy and vertuous men end their liues? Who then will ≈øay that it is not very true that, <hi>Factus ≈øum mihimet ip≈øi grauis,</hi> ≈øeeing that we are ≈øo much the better accepted of God, by how much wee are contrary vnto our ≈øelues. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle complained of this vvarre, when hee ≈øaid. <hi>O infaelix ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo! quis me liberabit de corpore mortis huius?</hi> his meaning was, O vnfortunate and ≈øorrowfull man as I am! vvhen vvill the day come, vvherein I may ≈øee my ≈øelfe free, and as it vvere exempted from my ≈øelfe, to the end that
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:3666:169"/>I may doe that which I would doe, and not as now, to de≈øire that which I ought not. Saint <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> ≈øpeaketh of this ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill warre in his Confe≈øsions, when he ≈øaid; <hi>Factus ≈øum mihimet ip≈øi grauis,</hi> ≈øeeing that I am bound and fettered, not with yrons and chains, but with my owne ≈øen≈øuality: but I gaue my vvill voluntarily vnto the Diuell, and of my vvill he maketh now that which I will not. <hi>An≈øelmus</hi> in his Meditations ≈øayth, I am made grieuous and painfull vnto my ≈øelfe, becau≈øe there is no man ≈øo contrary vnto mee, and ≈øo again≈øt mee, as I am to my ≈øelfe, and I am like a foole be≈øides my ≈øelfe, in ≈øo much that liuing within my ≈øelfe, yet I goe wandring abroad out of my ≈øelfe. <hi>I≈øidorus</hi> in his book <hi>De ≈øummo bono</hi> ≈øayth, I am made grieuous vnto my ≈øelfe, and for that cau≈øe my iudgement is ≈øo darkened, my memory ≈øo weakened, my thoughts ≈øo chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that I know not what I vvould haue although it be giuen me, nor I know not whereof I ≈øhould complaine although I bee demanded. Doe≈øt thou not thinke that my iudgement is ≈øore troubled, &amp; that I am an alien from my≈øelfe, ≈øeeing that I doe oftentimes, by de≈øiring to know that of my ≈øelfe that I know of others, enquire of my ≈øelfe for my ≈øelfe? <hi>Barnard</hi> ≈øayth in a Sermon, Am not I, good Ie≈øus, grieuous and painful vnto my ≈øelfe, ≈øeeing that if hunger doe make mee faint and weake, eating doth al≈øo loath mee, if cold doe weary me, the heat doth al≈øo mole≈øt me, if ≈øolitarine≈ø≈øe doe make mee ≈øad, company doth al≈øo importune me, in ≈øo much that I am plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed and contented vvith nothing, and am alwaies di≈øconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with my ≈øelfe? How can I bee plea≈øed with my owne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ≈øeeing that if I do behaue my ≈øelfe once like a wi≈øe man, I doe behaue my ≈øelfe an hundred times like an vndi≈øcreet man? S. <hi>Ambro≈øe</hi> in an Epi≈øtle to <hi>Theodo≈øius</hi> ≈øayth, Becau≈øe I am grieuous and painefull vnto my ≈øelfe, I doe withdraw my ≈øelfe from the company of men, becau≈øe they ≈øhould not change and di≈øgui≈øe mee, I flie from the diuell becau≈øe hee ≈øhould not entrap me, I for≈øake the world becau≈øe hee ≈øhould not damne mee, I renounce wealth and riches, becau≈øe they ≈øhould not corrupt mee, I refu≈øe all honour and dignities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe

S. <hi>Barnard</hi> vpon tho≈øe wordes of the P≈øalme, <hi>Sitiuit anima mea ad deum fontem viuum</hi> ≈øayth, O what a great difference there is betwixt the thir≈øt of the good and the bad, becau≈øe the bad thir≈øt after nothing but wickedne≈ø≈øe, and the good after vertues, the bad after tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things, and the good after ≈øpirituall, the one after ≈øinne, and the other after amendment, ≈øo that all the thir≈øt of the wicked is after ≈øinne, and the thir≈øt of the good after ≈øal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. <hi>Ba≈øil</hi> vpon the P≈øalme ≈øayth, The Prophet vvould neuer haue ≈øaid, My ≈øoule hath thir≈øted after God a liuely ≈øpring, if hee could haue found the fountayne of glory in this vvorld, and the vvater of grace in this life. But ala≈ø≈øe of how many vvaters ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer wee drinke of, and how many waters ≈øoeuer wee ≈øeeke for, wee ≈øhall neuer meet with the water of life, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till vvee come to enioy the diuine e≈ø≈øence. <hi>Hugo de ≈øan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto victore</hi> vpon the P≈øalme ≈øayth, All the thinges of this life are drie fountaines, and dead waters; &amp; conrary, all things of glory are fre≈øh fountaines and water of life: for there and not here vvee ≈øhall liue all contented, and not thir≈øt at all. All which liue in this vvorld, liue in hunger and thir≈øt, becau≈øe all the vices vvhich wee like of doe hurt and not profite, make vs ≈øorrowfull and not ioifull, vveary and not recreate vs, loath and not fill vs. What vicious man is there in the world, who the more he doth giue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe to vice, is not the more thir≈øty after them? Let not the Deuill deceaue thee, my brother, in ≈øaying I vvill now cloy and glut my ≈øelfe vvith vice: for the more thou doe≈øt eat and drinke and bee merry, although thou doe ≈øeeme to bee fully ≈øatisfied, yet thou art not ≈øo, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a vveary. Saint <hi>Barnard</hi> vpon the Pa≈øsion of our
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:3666:173"/>Lord ≈øayth, What dooth it meane that the ≈øonne of God went out of this vvorld dead with thir≈øt, but onely that there is nothing in this world that can quench the thir≈øt of our ≈øoule? <hi>An≈øelmus</hi> ≈øayth, How is it po≈øsible, O my good Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus, how is it po≈øsible that I ≈øhould liue in the vvorld conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and fully ≈øatisfied, ≈øeeing that thou didde≈øt depart out of it hungry and thir≈øty? S. <hi>Ierome</hi> vpon S. <hi>Luke</hi> ≈øaith, All that the vvorld doth giue vs to quench our thir≈øt withall, is but vineger, and all that hee giueth vs to mittigate our hunger is but gaule, the which thinges being vvell prooued doe take away our life, and not our thir≈øt. <hi>Robertus</hi> vpon Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ≈øayth, That for the ≈øon of God to die vvith thir≈øt, is to let vs vnder≈øtand, that haue we neuer ≈øo many dignities, let vs heap vp neuer ≈øo much riches, and let vs proue neuer ≈øo many vices, and let vs cocker our ≈øelues all we can, yet we ≈øhal depart with as great thir≈øt out of this world, as if we had not liued but one moment in it. In this ≈øorrowful life there is nothing but is thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øty: the fle≈øh doth thir≈øt after daintie cheri≈øhing, the ≈øoule doth thir≈øt after longer life, the heart dooth thir≈øt for more ≈øtrength, the Deuill to deceiue vs, and Chri≈øt doth thir≈øt after our ≈øaluation. Which of all the≈øe doe not liue in hunger and thir≈øt? What doth our fle≈øh but complaine in euery part, that we keepe it naked, that we keepe it hungry, weary, di≈øconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and dead with thir≈øt? What ≈øinfull ≈øoule did euer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of this vvretched life, ≈øo be≈øet vvith griefe, or loaden vvith yeares, vvhich vvould nor haue giuen all that hee had beene worth to haue liued one yeare longer?

Why are there ≈øo many ≈øorts of vices in the vvorld, and ≈øo many enti≈øements, but to quench the thir≈øt vvhich it hath, to make vs all vaine, vvordly, and light? Why did the ≈øonne of God come into the world, preach the Go≈øpell, liue in paine, and die vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, but onely for the great thir≈øt
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:3666:173"/>which he had to ≈øaue the world? Loe then, we haue prooued how the fle≈øh, the heart, the ≈øoule, the world, the diuell, and Chri≈øt, are all hungry and de≈øire thee O my ≈øoule: and that which cannot bee ≈øpoken without teares is, that onely Chri≈øt doth thir≈øt after thy ≈øaluation, and all the other after thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. O my ≈øoule, if thou hadde≈øt as great a thir≈øt to amend thy ≈øelfe, as Chri≈øt hath to ≈øaue thee, or if thou hadde≈øt as great a thir≈øt to amend thy ≈øelfe as the≈øe thy enemies haue to deceiue thee, I doe promi≈øe thee that thou woulde≈øt not liue as thou doe≈øt ≈øo carele≈ø≈øy, nor yet behaue thy ≈øelfe ≈øo rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tou≈øly. The good doe inherite the thir≈øt of our ble≈ø≈øed Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Ie≈øus Chri≈øt, and the wicked doe inherite the thir≈øt of the diuell. And what is the thir≈øt which the good doe inherite, but to be peacemakers, humble, cha≈øt, ≈øober, and very charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? And what is the thir≈øt which the wicked doe inherite of the deuill, but to bee more mighty, and rich, and more vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? O what great difference there is betwixt the≈øe two thir≈øts! for the thir≈øt of the good and vertuous goeth to bee quenched at the fountaine of life, which is glory; &amp; the thir≈øt of the wicked goeth to bee quenched at the dead waters of paine and puni≈øhment; in ≈øo much that ≈øuch as our thir≈øt is in this world, ≈øuch ≈øhall bee the water which wee ≈øhall drinke of in the other. O how wel the Prophet ≈øaid, My ≈øoule did thir≈øt after the liuing God, becau≈øe that all the water which our Lord doth giue vs to drinke is of the liuely fountaine, which is cleare vnto the eie, and fre≈øh to recreat, ≈øauerous to prouide of, and whole≈øome to ta≈øt of, delicare in di≈øge≈øting, and mo≈øt precious to keepe.

When our Lord did command <hi>Helias</hi> to goe out of Samaria, there was a great famine ouer all the land, and he was al≈øo per≈øecuted by the wicked queen <hi>Iezabel:</hi> and yet hauing an intention to ≈øuccour his Prophet, he appointed him a place far off, where he ≈øhould hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe, and prouided him all kind of victuals for him to eat. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> being gone to the brooke Carith, there hee lay hidden a long time, feeding only vpon that which the crows gaue him, and drinking of the water which ran in the ≈øtream. And after a few months were pa≈øt, and the Queens per≈øecution was cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed, and the famine amended, <hi>Helias</hi> returned to the people, and the crowes were ≈øeene no more. Before we doe come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the≈øe my≈øteries, it is here to bee noted, what great care our Lord hath ouer his ≈øeruants, and how he is neuer carele≈ø≈øe of his friends, becau≈øe his naturall condition is neuer to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull of tho≈øe which doe not forget to ≈øerue him. <hi>Cum ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo ≈øum, eripiam eum, &amp; glorificabo eum,</hi> ≈øaith the P≈øalmi≈øt in the name of our Lord: and his meaning is, I my ≈øelf, and no other,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:3666:174"/>will bee alwaies with him in his troubles, and I will bring him ≈øafe out of them, and he ≈øhall e≈øcape out of them with honor and glory. If wee doe well vnder≈øtand Chri≈øt, hee promi≈øeth three thinges vnto ≈øuch as ≈øuffer per≈øecution and tribulation for his ≈øeruice: The fir≈øt is, that hee will bee at their ≈øide in all troubles and vexations: the ≈øecond, that they ≈øhall neuer lo≈øe their life, nor endanger their con≈øcience for any trouble, be it neuer ≈øo ≈øtrong: the third, that hee will deliuer them out of that trouble with great fame and glory. If ≈øuch great profite be gotten by per≈øecution, why doth any man follow the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øures and delights of the world? What tribulation is there in this world ≈øo hard and dangerous, which is not ouercomed with the helpe of Chri≈øt? O how happy is that ≈øoule which is tempted for the ≈øeruice of God, and is per≈øecuted for the loue of him! ≈øeeing he hath giuen his word and his credit that he will not ≈øuffer any to fall in his temptation, nor for≈øake any man in his tribulation. Note gentle Reader, that Chri≈øt doth not ≈øay, I am with them <hi>In gaudio &amp; exultatione,</hi> in mirth and ioy, but <hi>In tribulatione,</hi> in tribulation: for as in this life he knew nothing but how to ≈øhed tears, ≈øuffer temptations, endure tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, ≈øo he hath compa≈øsion of none but of ≈øuch as weep, and are per≈øecuted and tempted; in ≈øo much that as the diuell is the captaine and ring-leader of all which liue in pompe and iolitie, ≈øo Chri≈øt is the head of all that are afflicted and in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation. Saint <hi>Barnard</hi> ≈øayth, If this that is ≈øaid, <hi>Cumip≈øo ≈øum in tribulatione,</hi> be not performed in thee, thinke with thy ≈øelf that thou doe≈øt not ≈øuffer that tribulation for Chri≈øt, but for thy friend and thy ≈øelfe; and therfore in that ca≈øe let him help and ≈øuccour thee for whome thou doe≈øt ≈øuffer that danger. If thou doe not make reckoning of Chri≈øt, nor thinke on him, nor ≈øuffer for his ≈øake, what hath Chri≈øt to doe with thy paint and trauaile? If thou do ≈øuffer for the fle≈øh, let the fle≈øh help thee, if thou ≈øuffer for the world, let the world deliuer thee, if thou ≈øuffer for thy friend, let thy friend giue thee aid, if thou doe ≈øuffer for Chri≈øt, to Chri≈øt commend thy ≈øelfe: for if thou doe ≈øerue others, what rea≈øon is it that thou ≈øhould≈øt ask
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:3666:175"/>fauour of him. Saint <hi>Ba≈øil</hi> ≈øayth, What friend had God at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time whom hee forgot, or in what tribulation did hee euer ≈øee him when hee helped him not? <hi>Gregory</hi> in his Regi≈øter ≈øayth, Hee who did not forget <hi>Noe</hi> in the floud, nor <hi>Abraham</hi> in Chaldea, nor <hi>Lot</hi> in Sodome, nor <hi>I≈øaac</hi> in Pale≈øtine, nor <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> in A≈ø≈øyria, nor <hi>Daniel</hi> in Babilon, doe≈øt thou think that he will forget thee in thy affliction and tribulation? <hi>Remigius</hi> ≈øayth, If this promi≈øe of <hi>Cum ip≈øo ≈øum in tribulatione,</hi> bee not kept with thee, thinke that our Lord dooth it, either for thy greater profite, or his owne ≈øeruice: for the greater the tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is which thou endure≈øt, the more thou doe≈øt merite for thy ≈øoule: and if it be not for this cau≈øe, it is becau≈øe thou ≈øhalt fall into ≈øome greater danger, from the which our Lord doth keepe his holy hand and diuine ≈øuccour to deliuer thee. And becau≈øe that the curious Reader may not thinke that wee ≈øwarue from our purpo≈øe, it is to bee noted, that the Prophet <hi>Helius</hi> (who≈øe figure we handled) was be≈øet with three grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous per≈øecutions, that is, with the warre which was in Iury, with the famine which was ouer all the land, and with <hi>Ieza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi> hatred. He dur≈øt not preach for feare of the Queene, hee dur≈øt not goe abroad for feare of the warre, hee dur≈øt not hide him≈øelfe for feare of famine and hunger; in ≈øo much that this holy Prophet was ≈øo much without hope of remedy, that he knew not whether hee ≈øhould haue his throat cut openly, or whether he ≈øhould die for hunger ≈øecretly. Our Lord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to fulfill his promi≈øe, <hi>Cum ip≈øo ≈øum in tribulatione,</hi> tooke him out of Iury, vnwitting to the ≈øouldiors; and did hide him in Carith, where no man could ≈øee him, and ≈øent him meat by crowes to feed on, and did prouide him a ≈øtreame of water to drinke of. Wee may gather by this example what a good Lord wee haue, and what care hee hath ouer vs if wee ≈øerue him, ≈øeeing that hee doth pay vs for all wee doe, and ≈øuccour vs for all that we ≈øuffer for him. To come now vnto the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe, all this figure was fulfilled in Chri≈øt at the foot of the letter: for as <hi>Heliac</hi> was per≈øecuted by <hi>Iezabel,</hi> ≈øo was Chri≈øt of the Synagogue, and Chri≈øt found as great a famine of good
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:3666:175"/>men, as <hi>Helias</hi> did in Samaria of victuals. <hi>Hugo de ≈øancto victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> ≈øayth vpon tho≈øe words of <hi>Ieremy, Paruuli petierunt panem,</hi> The bread which the little ones cried for to ear, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation which <hi>Ieremy</hi> made becau≈øe there was no man to giue it him, was not vnder≈øtood of the materiall bread which was woont to bee in the arke, but of ≈øpirituall bread, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the ≈øoules are fed: and to ≈øay that there was no man found to giue it them, was as much as to ≈øay, that there was no good man left to preach vnto them. <hi>Chri≈øo≈øtome</hi> in an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily ≈øayth, In Commonwealths well gouerned, the want of a good man is greater than the famine of bread and wine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe we haue ≈øeene that God hath ≈øent a famine for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits of one man alone, and after abundance for one good mans ≈øake alone. <hi>Ambro≈øe</hi> ≈øayth, Famine, warre, and pe≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, are much to bee feared in naughty Commonwealths, and where there are no good per≈øons: for although our Lord doth ≈øuffer them to come for a time, yet he doth not con≈øent that they ≈øhould long time endure. What goodne≈ø≈øe haue Commonwealths in them, if they haue no good men in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>? And what want they, if they doe not want good men? Saint <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> in his Confe≈øsions ≈øayth, When I hear a knill rung for the dead, my ≈øoule is pre≈øently driuen into a perplexity, whether I ≈øhould weepe fir≈øt for the good which die, or the bad which liue, becau≈øe there is as great rea≈øon that we ≈øhould weepe for the life of the bad, as for the death of the good. Now that we haue prooued, that the want &amp; famine of good men is more dangerous in a city than a dearth of victuals, who doth doubt but that the ≈øcar≈øene≈ø≈øe which Chri≈øt ≈øound in the Synagogue was greater than that which <hi>Helias</hi> found in Pale≈øtine? What good thing, or what good man could there be in the Synagogue, where the Viceroy <hi>Pilate</hi> was a Tyrant, the famous high Prie≈øt <hi>Caiphas</hi> a Symoniacle, &amp; the mai≈øters the Phari≈øies Hypocrites, and the coun≈øellours the Sadduces Heretikes, and their kings and Prophets all ended? The ≈øonne of God did kill this hunger, when hee gaue the world a church for a Synagogue, Apo≈øtles for Prophets, a
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:3666:176"/>law of loue for a law of feare, a new Te≈øtament for an old, the ≈øpirit for the letter, the truth for the figure, and his holy grace for our old offence. What would haue become of vs, if Chri≈øt had not left ≈øo many good men in his church? Hee left vs many Martyrs, many confe≈ø≈øours, many vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, many doctors; in ≈øo much that when Chri≈øt died, although hee left not the vvorld many bookes to read in, yet hee left vs many Saints to follow. The figure ≈øayth further, that <hi>Helias</hi> went to hide him≈øelfe in the water-brooke of Carith, which was a figure, that the ≈øonne of God ≈øhould come to take fle≈øh, and hide him≈øelfe in the entralls of the Virgines wombe: and as it was figured in <hi>Helias,</hi> ≈øo it was accompli≈øhed in Chri≈øt, becau≈øe that vnder his humanity vvhich hee tooke vpon him, hee did hide his diuinity which hee carried with him. When the Prophet <hi>E≈øayas</hi> ≈øaid, <hi>Ver√® tues deus ab≈øconditus,</hi> hee knew well that God would hide him≈øelfe for a time, and remoue him≈øelfe from their eies, ≈øeeing that the catholicke Church did acknowledge him, and the vnhappy Synagogue was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull vnto him. <hi>Recede hinc &amp; ab≈øconde te in torrentem Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rith:</hi> the eternall Father ≈øpake the≈øe words vnto his precious ≈øonne, as if hee had ≈øaid vnto him, Goe my ≈øonne, goe and hide thy ≈øelfe in the world, becau≈øe thou mai≈øt redeeme the world: Where thou ≈øhalt hide thy power becau≈øe thou mai≈øt ≈øuffer, thou ≈øhalt hide thy wi≈øedome, becau≈øe they may mock thee, thou ≈øhalt hide thy prudence, becau≈øe they may take thee to bee vnwi≈øe, thou ≈øhalt hide thy iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice, becau≈øe they are to iudge thee like a bla≈øphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and thou ≈øhalt hide thy ≈øtrength, becau≈øe thou mai≈øt the better die. O how well this was fulfilled in Chri≈øt, hide thy ≈øelfe in the water-brooke of Carith! for if he ≈øhould not haue hidden his great power before <hi>Pilate,</hi> who would haue been able to take his life from him? If the ≈øon of God ≈øhould not haue hidden his eternal wi≈øedome, dur≈øt the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øies haue mocked at his doctrine as they did? If Chri≈øt ≈øhould not haue hidden the rigour of his iu≈øtice, who would
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:3666:176"/>haue beene able to doe iu≈øtice vpon him? If Chri≈øt ≈øhould not haue hidden his inexpugnable ≈øtrength, how ≈øhould it haue beene po≈øsible for any man to draw his life out of his body? The Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> ≈øpake vnto this purpo≈øe, <hi>Ibi ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcondita est potentia eius,</hi> As if hee would haue ≈øaid: Thou mai≈øt not looke, O Synagogue, thou mai≈øt not looke for a Me≈øsias which will bee mighty but weake, not rich but poor, not in health but ≈øicke: do not imagine that he ≈øhould be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable but throwne downe; doe not proclaime him for to bee a great Lord but a ≈øeruant; hee ≈øhall not bee a warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, but a man of peace; and hee ≈øhall not goe much openly, but for the mo≈øt part in hucker mucker. Seeing that <hi>E≈øaias</hi> ≈øayth, thou art truly a hidden God, and al≈øo <hi>Zacharias</hi> that his power is hidden, why dooth the Synagogue looke that the Me≈øsias ≈øhould come openly, con≈øidering that their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ≈øaid that hee was to come ≈øecretly? <hi>Origen</hi> in his Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archon ≈øayth, Becau≈øe the ≈øonne of God came not to fight with vi≈øible men, but with inui≈øible ≈øinnes and enemies, there was no nece≈øsity that he ≈øhould come fighting, but preaching, it was not needful that hee ≈øhould wander ouer all the world, but only publi≈øh his Go≈øpell among them all, and if the arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Iewes did not reach vnto the knowledge thereof, it was not becau≈øe they could not, but becau≈øe they would not. <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophilus</hi> ≈øayth: ≈øpeaking with the church the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ≈øayth, <hi>Deus no≈øter manife≈øte veniet;</hi> and ≈øpeaking vvith the Synagogue, the Propht <hi>E≈øay</hi> ≈øayth, <hi>Vere tu es deus ab≈øcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus,</hi> and therevpon it happeneth, that the vnhappie I≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, although they were learned in knowledge, yet of no credite in con≈øcience, and ≈øo they de≈øerued not to know him, becau≈øe they vvould not beleeue him. The figure goeth further and ≈øayth, that the place where <hi>Helias</hi> went to hide him≈øelfe, vvas at water-brookes of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rith, which is as much to ≈øay as, a thing cut in ≈øunder, or parted in the middle, which had bin once whole. The water-brooke where Chri≈øt did hide him≈øelfe, was the depth and vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his pa≈øsion, where our good Lord entered diuing and

He was ≈øo hidden in the brooke of his pa≈øsion, that there was no part of his diuinity ≈øeene, and the beauty of his humanity ≈øcar≈øely perceiued: and becau≈øe our ble≈ø≈øed Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer would ≈øuffer his enemies to be reuenged on him, hee did ≈øu≈øpend for that time, the operation of tho≈øe miracles which might haue hindered his pa≈øsion. The figure ≈øayth further, that the Prophet <hi>Helias</hi> being in the brooke ≈øecret and clo≈øe, crowes of the fields brought him his dinner in the forenoon, and his ≈øupper at night, ≈øo that the birds gaue him to eat, and the water to drink. If this my≈øtery were not a figure and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling of ≈øome other great my≈øtery, it were to bee thought, that as God did ≈øend the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> meat by <hi>Abachuch</hi> the Prophet, ≈øo hee would haue ≈øent <hi>Helias</hi> meat by ≈øome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prophet, or holy man. If by <hi>Helias</hi> Chri≈øt be figured, by <hi>Iezabel</hi> the Synagogue, by the per≈øecution his pa≈øsion, and by the brooke the cro≈ø≈øe, and by the water his bloud, and by his hiding him≈øelfe his death, why ≈øhould not the crowes ≈øignifie the Iews? Seeing there were Eagles inowe in the aire, and Pigeons plenty in the world, what great ability did God ≈øee in the crow, that he ≈øhould make him ≈øteward vnto <hi>Helias</hi> his faithfull friend? What was the meaning that God did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <hi>Helias</hi> to the crowes, but that hee ≈øhould al≈øo commit his ≈øonne into the hands of the Iewes? The qualities of a Crow are, to bee in colour blacke, in flying flow, in his fle≈øh hard, in ≈ømelling quicke, in eating rauenous, and in condition vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. And becau≈øe the rauen or crow is an vngratefull bird, the Prouerbe is, that if thou bring vp a Crow, hee will pecke out thy eie. The people of the Iewes were an vngratefull Crow vnto Chri≈øt, ≈øeeing that for a recompence that he tooke fle≈øh
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:3666:177"/>of them, and taught them ≈øo long time, although they did not pecke out his eies, yet they crucified all his members on the cro≈ø≈øe. What bad thing is there in the crow, that is not al≈øo in the Iewes? They are blacke in faith, ≈ølow in iudgement, hard in beliefe, cruell in condition, ready to malice, and mo≈øt couetous. What meaneth this, O my Father, what meaneth this? After that thy ≈øonne had liued thirty three whole years, doe≈øt thou command him to be ca≈øt vnto Crowes? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Crowes which we ≈øee with our eies, are not ≈øo cruell as the Iewes which wee ≈øpeake off, becau≈øe the Crowes doe eat of nothing vntill it be dead, but the wicked Iewes did venter vpon Chri≈øt when hee was yet aliue. O that <hi>Helias</hi> did farre better with his Crowes, than the good Ie≈øus with the Iewes, becau≈øe <hi>Helias</hi> Crowes did giue him bread and fle≈øh to eat, but Chri≈øts crowes gaue him nothing but vineger and gaule to ta≈øt. Let the conclu≈øion of all our ≈øpeech be, that it was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with <hi>Helias</hi> in his bani≈øhment and water-brooke, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> with Chri≈øt on the Mount of Caluary, becau≈øe <hi>Helias</hi> went out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue from the water, and Chri≈øt remained dead on the Mount of Caluary, and <hi>Helias</hi> did neuer know what hunger was, but the ≈øonne of God did neuer kill his hunger, nor quench his thir≈øt.</p>

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:3666:178"/>that within the Temple, and hard at the altar they dranke the wine which was prepared for the condemned, and they lay downe and leaned vpon the garments which were laid to pledge. It is an v≈øuall thing and common in tauerns, that drunkards doe ca≈øt them≈øelues downe to ≈øleepe vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens apparrell, and if it bee in hote Summer, to ≈øleepe vpon the benches of the Temple. If there were no greater matter contained vnder this complaint and rebuke, and if the ≈øence were not of greater weight than the letter, and the thing figured worthier than the figure, it was no new thing, nor rare fault, to drinke of another mans wine, or ca≈øt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe vpon ≈øome cloke laid to pledge, or to ≈øleepe in the holy Temple. That which God ≈øpeaketh here, and that which our Lord complaineth of, reacheth further than it ≈øeemeth for, and dooth draw vs vnto a deeper my≈øtery than outwardly it appeareth: for if we marke it well, God did neuer ≈øpeake vnto the Synagogue, but it did redound afterward to ≈øome my≈øte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the church. Fir≈øt the Prophet in this place maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of certain garments: ≈øecondly, that tho≈øe garments were a pawne and pledge: thirdly, that they were laid neere vnto an altar: fourthly, that drunkards lay vpon them: fiftly, that they dranke there much wine: ≈øixtly, that that wine was the wine of condemned per≈øons: and then that they dranke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the holy Temple. What one of the≈øe words dooth want his my≈øtery, or what circum≈øtance is there not worthy of deepe con≈øideration? In the ≈øelfe≈øame ≈øort that this was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied by <hi>O≈øee,</hi> it was fulfilled by Chri≈øt: for wine being brought for Chri≈øt to drinke of, and al≈øo the other theeues, the Iewes did not onely not giue it them, but did them≈øelues drinke it, &amp; then being very dronk, they took Chri≈øts clothes, and ca≈øt them on the ground, and ≈øate vpon them. When the Prophet ≈øayth, that they dranke the wine, &amp; lay down vpon the garments hard by the altar, hee ≈øayth mo≈øt truly: for the fir≈øt church that euer was in the world was the Mount of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uary, the fir≈øt altar was the cro≈ø≈øe, the fir≈øt ≈øacrifice offered vp for the redemption of man, was his own body to be crucified
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:3666:178"/>on good Friday, vpon the ≈øame altar of the cro≈ø≈øe the fir≈øt faithfull were the Virgine and Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> with the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtles and ≈øecret di≈øciples. In that holy Temple, and by that ≈øacred altar, who were they which leaned &amp; were ca≈øt down vpon the garments, but onely the vnhappy and vnfortunate Iewes? Thinke it is a great my≈øtery, that the Prophet did not ≈øee tho≈øe of his Synagogue ≈øitting, but leaning neere vnto the altar, to let vs vnder≈øtand, that they be neither open Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, nor conceiled Iewes: for Chri≈øtians they could not bee, becau≈øe they will not beleeue in Chri≈øt; and if they will bee Iewes they haue no Temple where to Iudaize. <hi>Robertus</hi> ≈øayth, Vntill this day the Iewes are not pro≈øtrate before the altar, which is Chri≈øt, to beleeue him, nor yet on their knees to wor≈øhip him, nor on foot to defend him, nor embracing him in ≈øigne of loue, but leaning to offend him, becau≈øe their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is to tread his holy garments vnder feet, and keepe off Ie≈øus Chri≈øt from them with their elbowes. Taking this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe≈øie in another ≈øence, it is to bee noted, that oftentimes in Scripture by good garments are vnder≈øtood good works, and by torne garments naughty workes; and therevpon it is, that as the body is clad and fo≈øtered with a new garment, ≈øo the ≈øoule is decked and garni≈øhed with holy workes. And becau≈øe that the curious Reader may not thinke that we ≈øpeak at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, we will proue our ≈øaying by Scripture. What was the meaning that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ≈øaw Chri≈øt <hi>Ve≈øtitum ponere,</hi> which was to ≈øee him with a long garment, but to ≈øee him loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with vertues from the head to the foot? Hee that went to the wedding not hauing his nuptiall garment, but becau≈øe hee was vncomely clothed, was carried to pri≈øon: who is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øented vnto vs, but hee, who although he doe lead an euill life, yet dooth dare to enioy Chri≈øtian liberty? When God doth command in the Apocalips, <hi>Omni tempore ve≈øtimenta tua ≈øint candida,</hi> let thy garments be white alwaies, what doth he ≈øignifie, but that we ≈øhould be all cleane and vertuous? When the Scripture ≈øaith, that <hi>Iacob</hi> made his ≈øonne <hi>Io≈øeph, Tunicam polymitam,</hi> that is, an embrodered garment downe to the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:3666:179"/>ground. What was the meaning that his garment did reach ≈øo low, but that the ≈øonne of God ≈øhould be perfite in all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues? What did it ≈øignifie that the Iewes did ca≈øt clothes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the a≈ø≈øe feet to goe ouer, and the Apo≈øtle put them vpon the a≈ø≈øe which Chri≈øt rode vpon, but that he mi≈øliked all that the Synagogue did, and approoued all that the church did? S. <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> ≈øayth, Becau≈øe in holy writ, by the garments which wee weare are vnder≈øtood the works which wee doe, wee may truly ≈øay, that no man goeth well clothed but the vertuous man, nor no man with a torne coat but the wicked and naughty ≈øinner. Chri≈øt did v≈øe but two garments in this world, the one next his skin, which was without ≈øeame, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an vpper garment which ≈øerued him for a cloke &amp; coat; in ≈øo much that Chri≈øt did ≈øhew the perfection of his pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty not only in his diet, but al≈øo in the ≈øimplene≈ø≈øe of his appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell. <hi>Barnard</hi> ≈øayth, The ≈øonne of God did teach vs not onely to liue, but al≈øo to apparell our≈øelues, becau≈øe his holy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were few in number, vild in colour, ≈ømall of price, good in profite, but cleane in v≈øe. <hi>Hylarius</hi> ≈øayth, Although the garments which the ≈øonne of God ware were but few, vild &amp; torne, yet the Scripture dooth much e≈øteeme of them, not for the value vvhich they are vvorth, but for the great my≈øteries which they did ≈øignifie. <hi>Origen</hi> in an Homily ≈øayth, What vvere the garments vvhich the ≈øonne of God vvent alwaies clad vvith, but his diuine and humane nature, wherof he was made? His coat without ≈øeame, and in which there neuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred needle nor ≈øci≈ø≈øers, was his diuine nature in great purity glorious from the beginning, in the which there was no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, nor ≈øhall bee no end; for that nature is now as it was from the beginning, and ≈øhall be for euer as it is at this in≈øtant. By the other coat vvhich vvas ≈øowne and cur, is vnder≈øtood Chri≈øts ≈øacred humanity, vvhich vvas formed by the Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gho≈øt, and borne of the Virgine <hi>Mary,</hi> and therefore Chri≈øts vvearing of the≈øe two coats doth ≈øignifie, that hee and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is God and man, and the ≈øonne vvhich vvas incarnate. Before that Chri≈øt tooke fle≈øh, hee had but one coat to couer
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:3666:179"/>≈øelfe withall, which was his diuinity: but after that hee came into the vvorld, he put on another coat, vvhich vvas his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and by that means he did lend vs his coat to make vs holy, and vvee did lend him ours to make him a man. Saint <hi>Chri≈øostome</hi> ≈øayth, The one of Chri≈øts coats, to wit, that vvhich vvas vvithout ≈øeame, continued vvhole and vntorne in his pa≈øsion, but his vppermo≈øt garment vvas rent and torne, to giue vs to vnder≈øtand, that although his enemies had power to lay hands vpon his ≈øacred humanity, yet they had none at all to touch his diuinity. <hi>Dama≈øcen</hi> ≈øayth, One of Chri≈øts coats fell vvhole and entire vnto the knights, and the other torne and ragged vnto the hangmen, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe vvee ≈øhould vnder≈øtand, that to the catholicke church there fell the entire and whole coat, ≈øeeing that ≈øhee dooth fully beleeue that Chri≈øt is both God and man, and vnto the Synagogue there happened his torn coat, ≈øeeing they beleeue that hee is no more than a bare man. Saint <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> ≈øayth, By Chri≈øts two garments are vnder≈øtood both his bodies, that is, his true body made and compacted of his holy mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and his my≈øticall body, which are all good Chri≈øtians: and becau≈øe thou maie≈øt perceaue, my brother, how much thou art bound vnto Chri≈øt, know thou, that hee did e≈øteeme better of his my≈øticall body, vvhich are Chri≈øtians, than of his owne true body which vvas made of his owne mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. What vvas his meaning that hee ≈øuffered them to take away and teare in pieces the one of his coats, and yet neuer touch the other, but only that hee is more grieued when any man doth ≈øpeake euill of his church, than to haue laid hands vpon his owne proper per≈øon? <hi>Remigius</hi> ≈øayth, O how whole, and entire hee did leaue vs the vn≈øowne coat of his church! and yet naughty Chri≈øtians and perfideous Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, doe rent his coat into as many pieces, as they doe rai≈øe di≈ø≈øentions, and ≈øtirre vp here≈øies in the church. It was Chri≈øts holy vvill to die not only without a coat, but al≈øo not to haue one thred of a coat vpon him, which hee did ≈øuffer to the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:3666:180"/>great preiudice of his grauity, and lo≈ø≈øe of his credite. Who was euer, or vvho euer ≈øhall bee ≈øo graue in his doctrine, as the ≈øonne of God vvas, and ≈øo hone≈øt in his per≈øon? And ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>E≈øayas</hi> ≈øayth, that hee was offered vp becau≈øe hee would, it is to bee beleeued, that ≈øeeing they could not cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him, if he him≈øelfe vvould not, ≈øo they could neither haue ≈øtripped him naked vnle≈ø≈øe he had con≈øented vnto it. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it followeth in a good con≈øequence, that if hee would die for our redemption, that hee did let him≈øelfe bee ≈øtripped for our comfort. What did it ≈øignifie that the ≈øonne of God did put off all his garments, but that hee did di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe him≈øelfe of all his good workes? I and thou, thou and I, my brother, haue great need to die clothed and clad, to wit, vvith our owne faith and good vvorks, and al≈øo bee helped by others. For as for holy Ie≈øus, as hee came out of the vvombe of his mother vnited vnto the diuine e≈ø≈øence, ≈øo hee had no nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity of his owne vvorkes, to ≈øaue him≈øelfe, nor of other mens merits to pardon vs. <hi>Cyrillus</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ≈øayth, Of as much as the ≈øonne of God did merite praying on the mountaine, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching among the people, healing the di≈øea≈øed in ho≈øpitals, by ≈øuffering among his enemies, and dying vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, I ≈øay hee did ≈øpoile and make him≈øelfe naked of all that, and put it vpon vs; in≈øomuch that wee are heires of his bloud with which he redeemed vs, and ≈øucce≈ø≈øors of all the merits which hee heaped together. O glorious inheritance, and happie wealth, which thou good Ie≈øus didde≈øt leaue to the pari≈øhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of thy church! ≈øeeing that by the meanes thereof, vvee are made ≈øonnes of the Father, brothers of the ≈øonne, puples of the Holy gho≈øt, companions to the Angels, pari≈øhioners of the church, and heires of thy glory. O vvhat great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is betwixt the inheritance of heauen, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in the world! Worldlings leaue their children ≈øtore of goods and reuenues, and much debate and ≈øtrife to defend them, and many enemies to per≈øecute them: but our good Lord in lieue of great wealth did leaue vs his grace, and in
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:3666:180"/>≈øteed of enemies did leaue vs his merites. What ≈øhould haue become of all the ≈øinners of the world, if as Chri≈øt died ≈øpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and depriued of his goods, ≈øo hee would haue died clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed vvith all his merits? What ≈øhould become vnto prowd men, if hee would not haue left them his humilitie, and vvhat of cruell men if hee would not haue left them his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie? What end ≈øhould angry men come to, if he ≈øhould not haue left them his patience, and vvhat vvere it of all ≈øinners, if hee ≈øhould not haue left them his clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? <hi>Cyprian</hi> ≈øayth, If Chri≈øt would haue a≈øcended to heauen vvith all that which hee merited in this world, and not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part it among vs, and as it were vnclothed him≈øelfe of them as of certaine garments, there ≈øhould not haue been in the world at this day a church to preach in, nor Prie≈øt to bee ordained, nor Sacrament to bee admini≈øtred. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillus</hi> ≈øayth to this purpo≈øe, If the ≈øonne of God would haue merited for him≈øelfe alone, and died for him≈øelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, wee might haue ≈øaid with rea≈øon, that hee had come into the vvorld, and tooke fle≈øh vpon him for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe, and not for vs. But let ≈øuch bla≈øphemy bee farre from our tongues and thoughts, and farre from our heart, becau≈øe our good Lord died not for him≈øelfe, but for vs, nor did not merite for him≈øelfe, but for vs. <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go de ≈øancto victore</hi> ≈øayth, Becau≈øe that the great Redeemer of the world did leaue vs his garments for reliques, and his merites for Trea≈øures, the Church his ≈øpou≈øe hath at this day, Sacraments to giue, ≈øacrifices of a contrite heart to offer, ≈øweet doctrine to preach, and rewards to promi≈øe for amendment of life.</p>

There were but two garments in all, and Chri≈øt was the mai≈øter of them, and they were deuided betwixt hangmen and ≈øouldiours, the place where was by the cro≈ø≈øe, and the manner how was by lots. The≈øe two garments were deuided betwixt the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which kept and guarded Chri≈øt, and the hangme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> which crucified Chri≈øt, in≈øomuch that according vnto the merite or demerite of euery one of them, they receiued their part of the garment. <hi>Theophilus</hi> ≈øaith, Who are meant by the≈øe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and knights, but the vertuous and iu≈øt; and who by the hangmen but ≈øinners and naughty men? O infinit good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe, O clemency neuer ≈øeene before! ≈øuch as thine was O good Ie≈øus vpon the altar of the cro≈ø≈øe, where thou didde≈øt barre no man of the inheritance of thy ≈øweatings, and deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of thy merits, depriue no man, exclude no man, nor di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherite no man, but there fell a≈øwel one part to the hangmen which lifted thee vp vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, as to <hi>Nichodemus</hi> who
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:3666:181"/>tooke thee down from the ≈øame. <hi>I≈øichius</hi> vpon <hi>Leuiticus</hi> ≈øaith, As the ≈øonne of God was the Redeemer of all men, ≈øo his plea≈øure was, that his garments ≈øhould be deuided for all, and that none ≈øhould be excluded from the generall redemption; which he did pre≈øently him≈øelfe declare, ≈øeeing that he ≈øaued the theefe who was a Iew, and conuerted the Centurion who was a Gentile. O what great hope wee haue to be ≈øaued, and what great confidence that Chri≈øt will pardon vs! for ≈øeeing that hee hath di≈øtributed part of his merites and garments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong butcherly hangmen, it is to be beleeued, that hee will giue with a better will vnto his cho≈øen friends. The difference in deuiding his garments was this, that tho≈øe cruell hangmen did immediately deuide and teare in pieces his garment as it was giuen them, and the Gentlemen kept it whole as it fell vnto them, in ≈øo much that in the handling of the garments, the per≈øons qualities might ea≈øily haue been knowne. That which the Iewes did in tho≈øe daies, the ≈øelfe ≈øame doe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtians at this day: for tho≈øe which are good doe keepe all that Chri≈øt commanded them, and tho≈øe which are wicked, keep no more than plea≈øe them: in≈øomuch that the good and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Chri≈øtian doth keepe Chri≈øts garment entire &amp; whole, by endeuouring him≈øelfe to keepe the commandements; and the wicked and peruer≈øe doe keepe it rent and torne, and be content with the bare name of Chri≈øtians. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ≈øayth, If thou do ≈øee thy ≈øelf, my brother, prowd in pre≈øumption, enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in ambition, angry in impaciency, a glutton in eating, &amp; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous in giuing, tell me I pray thee, what doe≈øt thou hold of a Chri≈øtian, and what doe≈øt thou want of a Pagan? What greater di≈øa≈øter and lo≈ø≈øe could happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> vnto thy ≈øoule, or what like euill fall vpon thy body, than of all the di≈øtribution and deuiding of Chri≈øts coats and merites, there ≈øhould fall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to thy lot but the name of a Chri≈øtian?

O how vnhappy they be, vnto whome there fell no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a ≈øhred of Chri≈øts garment, that is, to brag that hee
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:3666:182"/>hath heard the Go≈øpell preached, and that hee was bapti≈øed like a Chri≈øtian. For Chri≈øt is not content only with that, but his plea≈øure is, that as he gaue vs all his garments freely, ≈øo he will that wee ≈øerue him with all our might and forces. With the hangmen there fell a ≈øhred of Chri≈øts garment vnto him who keepeth but one commandement onely, and vnto him his whole coat which keepeth all that Chri≈øt commandeth: for Chri≈øt ≈øaid not vnto the young man, who asked him what he ≈øhould doe to goe to heauen, Keep the commandement, but keep, &amp; ob≈øerue the commandements. There fell a ≈øhred or ragge of Chri≈øts garment vnto him, who thinketh to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerue the Go≈øpell onely by wi≈øhing well; and vnto him it fell whole and entire, who ≈øerueth him with workes and deeds, and not with de≈øires: for as Saint <hi>Barnard</hi> ≈øayth, The heauens are repleni≈øhed with good workes, and hell is full of good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øires. S. <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> ≈øayth, As of children which doe equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herite their fathers goods, ≈øome doe encrea≈øe their portion, &amp; ≈øome wa≈øt and con≈øume it; ≈øo is it in the church of God: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all were inheritours of the garments &amp; merits of the ≈øon of God, yet ≈øome doe di≈øsipate and tear them to their own perdition, and ≈øome con≈øerue and keep them to their ≈øaluation.

For the Prophet to lay downe as a great fault and offence, that the Synagogue dur≈øt bee ≈øo bold as to leane vpon certaine garments which were laid to pawne, it mu≈øt be expounded with great diligence, and read with great heed, becau≈øe that in Scripture the newer and more vnu≈øuall a tearme is, the greater my≈øtery it doth contain.

<pb n="359" facs="tcp:3666:182"/>as this, the newne≈ø≈øe whereof vvil bring vs to the knowledge of the other. The new ≈øpeech is this, <hi>Ecce noua facio omnia;</hi> Which vvords Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in the Apocalips heard Chri≈øt ≈øpeak. Behold &amp; mark vvel all you vvhich be of my Church, how I doe not that which others haue done, nor vndertake that vvhich others haue vndertaken, nor teach that vvhich others haue taught, nor liue as others haue liued, becau≈øe that in my life and family there is no corrupt &amp; rotten thing, but all ≈øound and whole, nor any old thing but all new. This is ≈øuch a new kind of ≈øpeech, that no man euer ≈øpake the like vntill the ≈øonne of God came: and to ≈øay the truth, vnle≈ø≈øe it vvere he who had created all things, who was able to renue all things? For if all the Angels, and all men are not able to make a flie, how ≈øhould they be able to make a new vvorld? <hi>Rupertus</hi> ≈øayth, O how well Chri≈øt ≈øayth, in ≈øaying, Behold I make all new! for beginning in him≈øelfe, he was a new man, he had a new ≈øoule, tooke new fle≈øh, gaue new light, taught new doctrine, liued a new life, and promi≈øed new glory. Was hee not a new man, ≈øeeing that no man but hee was both God and man? Who but hee had a new ≈øoule, ≈øeeing that his and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vvas vnited to the diuine per≈øon? took he not new fle≈øh, ≈øeeing that none but he vvas of a mother and a virgine? Who but he gaue the vvorld a new law, ≈øeeing that he vvas the fir≈øt vvhich preached the Go≈øpell? did he not al≈øo promi≈øe a new reward vnto his elect, ≈øeeing none before him promi≈øed the kingdome of heauen? <hi>Si volueritis &amp; audieritis me, bona terrae commedetis,</hi> ≈øaid God. <hi>E≈øay</hi> 1. as if hee ≈øhould ≈øay, If you vvill beleeue me, &amp; keep my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mandements, I vvill giue you vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory again≈øt your enemies, I vvill giue you health to your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, I vvill giue you corne in your fields, and I vvill giue you peace in your kingdomes.

Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> ≈øaith in a Sermon, As the ≈øonne of God did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand vs to keepe new precepts, ≈øo he did promi≈øe vs new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for it, and as hee gaue great commandements, ≈øo hee gaue great rewards: wherevpon it is, that vntil hee came into the world, no man commanded that which hee commanded, nor no man promi≈øed that which he promi≈øed. Chri≈øt ≈øaid not in vaine, <hi>Ecce noua facio omnia,</hi> but becau≈øe hee in≈øtituted the Sacrament, which was a hard thing to reach vnto, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded vs to beleeue the ble≈ø≈øed Trinity, which is a high matter to vnder≈øtand, willed vs to beleeue him both God &amp; man, which is a new thing to bee receiued, charged vs to loue our enemies, which is a hard matter to doe, and commanded vs to keepe his law only, which was a new thing in the world to doe. S. <hi>Thomas</hi> in his book again≈øt the Gentiles ≈øayth, That as the ≈øonne of God did not command tho≈øe of the old law to beleeue great things, ≈øo he did not promi≈øe them but ≈ømall things, and becau≈øe hee commanded his cho≈øen Chri≈øtians to beleeue hard things, and performe things which were not ea≈øily done, he promi≈øed that they ≈øhould po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe and emoy very high rewards. To come then vnto the text of <hi>Ve≈øtimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis pignoratis, &amp;c.</hi> It is to bee noted, that as the ≈øeruice of the iu≈øt was to bee done here vpon earth, and the reward which they are to receiue to be giuen aboue in heauen; becau≈øe wee ≈øhould not thinke that hee mocked vs, in deferring our pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the other world, his plea≈øure was to leaue vs a good gage and pledge in this world, vntill he ≈øhould reward vs for our good life in heauen. The pledges which Chri≈øt left vs in this world were his precious garments, his holy works, and his mo≈øt holy Sacraments. Why did Chri≈øt, thinke≈øt thou, leaue vs ≈øo many pledges in this life, but becau≈øe hee will vnpawne them afterward aboue in his glory? In his glory aboue all
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:3666:183"/>tho≈øe pledges ≈øhall bee taken away and haue an end, becau≈øe that in heauen we ≈øhall need to hope for nothing, becau≈øe we ≈øhall ≈øee that with our eies, which now we de≈øire; nor we ≈øhall haue nothing to beleeue, becau≈øe there ≈øhall be nothing hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; wee ≈øhall haue no cau≈øe to feare, becau≈øe there ≈øhall bee no death; wee ≈øhall need to aske for nothing, becau≈øe life is there euerla≈øting; neither ≈øhal we de≈øire any thing, ≈øeeing that glory is there perpetuall. O how happie be all Chri≈øtian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ≈øeeing they haue not only Chri≈øts garments for a pledge and ho≈øtage, but al≈øo Chri≈øt him≈øelfe remaining with vs, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the vi≈øible ≈øigns of the Sacrament, vntil he giue him≈øelfe vnto vs in heauen glorified! Let no man maruell to heare vs ≈øay, that we haue Chri≈øt for a pledge &amp; pawne, for that which his Father promi≈øed vs, ≈øeeing that the Apo≈øtle ≈øaith al≈øo that we haue the Holy gho≈øt for a pledge, for that which the ≈øon commanded vs, <hi>Ip≈øe est pignus haereditatis meae,</hi> as if he would ≈øay, God the eternal Father hath giuen vs the gifts of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gho≈øt, and all the garments and merites of his ≈øonne for a pledge of that which hee hath promi≈øed vs; and this no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger but vntill hee will carry vs to his eternall glory, and giue vs the fruition of his diuine e≈ø≈øence.

The Angell <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael</hi> ≈øpake the≈øe words vnto young <hi>Tobias,</hi> as if hee would ≈øay; Crie not, nor bee not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of this fi≈øh, but take him out of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, flay him, cut him in the middle, and take out his heart, his gaule, and liuer, and keepe it all for thy ≈øelfe, becau≈øe it is all very medicinable to cure a ≈øicke man. The ≈øtory of <hi>Tobias</hi> is very well knowne to the learned in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. When he ≈øent his young ≈øonne <hi>Tobias</hi> to Rages a towne of the Medes, for the recouering of tenne markes of ≈øiluer which he had lent his friend <hi>Gabelus,</hi> when hee was captiue in Babilon, and when yong <hi>Tobias</hi> came to the riuer Tygris, to wa≈øh his feet, there came foorth a very great fi≈øh to the banck ≈øide toward him, with ≈øuch boldne≈ø≈øe, as if hee would haue eaten and ≈øwallowed him vp, before that hee could flie from him. When the Angell ≈øaw the fiercene≈ø≈øe of this fi≈øh, and the great feare that the youth was ≈øtroke into, hee began to encourage him, ≈øaying: Feare not the fi≈øh, becau≈øe the fi≈øh ought rather to be afraid of thee, and therefore it is nece≈ø≈øary that thou do by him that which he would haue done to thee, becau≈øe another cannot recouer health before this fi≈øh bee killed. <hi>Tobias</hi> tooke heart by the encouragement of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, and fa≈øtening on the fi≈øh by the gilles, drew him out of the water, and ≈øtripped him, and tooke out his heart, and his gaule, and his liuer, as the Angell his ma≈øter had commanded him to doe. Now that <hi>Tobias</hi> fear was pa≈øt, when the fi≈øh was dead and drawne, he ≈øaid vnto his Angell: Tell mee brother <hi>Azarias,</hi> to what purpo≈øe thou didde≈øt command mee to
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:3666:184"/>keepe the fi≈øhes heart, gaule, and liuer, and didde≈øt not bid me eat at all of him. To this the Angell an≈øwered, Thou mu≈øt vnder≈øtand, my ≈øonne <hi>Tobias,</hi> that this thy iourney, and this chance which hath befaln vnto thee, wanteth not a great my≈øtery, as hereafter it ≈øhall appeare. But for the pre≈øent, let it ≈øuffice thee to know, that the meat of this fi≈øh is good for trauailers to eat of, and the heart good to ca≈øt out diuels, and the gaule good to heale the blind, and the liuer ≈øoueraine for to cure other externall di≈øea≈øes. There are pre≈øented vnto vs many deepe my≈øteries in this figure, if it may plea≈øe God to giue mee the knowledge to expound them; for in it is ≈øet foorth the wonderfull death which the ≈øonne of God ≈øuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the in≈øpeakeable fruit and benefite vvhich vvee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by it. Here is to bee vnder≈øtood, who <hi>Tobias</hi> is vvhich taketh the iourney, what the fi≈øh is which put him into a fright, what garbi≈øh he tooke from him, what skin he ≈øtripped him of, what is the fle≈øh which hee broiled, what is the heart which hee tooke out of him, what the liuer, and vvhat the gaule which hee kept. Although wee ≈øpeake but a word on euery word, yet this ≈øeemeth to bee a figure full of great ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets. To come then to the point, who is <hi>Tobias</hi> who goeth to recouer his fathers goods, but onely all mankind, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth euery day a iourney, to recouer the grace which his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Adam</hi> lo≈øt? <hi>Dum ≈øumus in ≈øeculo, peregrinamur ad domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> ≈øayth the Apo≈øtle, As long as vvee liue in this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall vvorld, no man can ≈øay that hee hath a dwelling place, or neighbour, but onely, that hee is a pilgrime and a way-faring man, and the end of our iourney and pilgrimage is, to ≈øeeke for the grace vvhich our fir≈øt father lo≈øt vs, and the glory which our eternall father promi≈øed vs. Then wee ≈øay a man is a pilgrime when he maketh no abode any where, but goeth on, and ≈øtaieth no longer in a place than hee can get nece≈ø≈øaries for his iourney. If vvee aske a man what hee doth, it is an ordinary an≈øwere to ≈øay, that hee either plaieth, or doth his bu≈øine≈ø≈øe, or ≈øome ≈øuch like, which in truth is not ≈øo, but his better an≈øwere is to ≈øay, that he wa≈øteth
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:3666:185"/>and con≈øumeth him≈øelfe, and that he is a dying; for a mans life goeth away in playing and labouring. <hi>Seneca</hi> ≈øayth, Doth not thy life, thinke≈øt thou, goe away, ≈øeeing that euery houre thy life is an houre ≈øhorter, and euery day a day ≈øhorter? Saint <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> vpon the Apo≈øtles words ≈øayth, If a man be asked how old he is, or what yeares hee hath, he is wont to an≈øwere either thirty, or fortie, or ≈øuch like; which is cleane contrary vnto that which hee ≈øhould an≈øwere: for hee ≈øhould not ≈øay he hath ≈øo many yeares, but that he wanteth ≈øo many yeares: for if he haue any years at all, it bee tho≈øe which hee looketh for; for as for tho≈øe which are pa≈øt, they are now none of his. The Philo≈øopher ≈øaith, that <hi>De tempore non habemus ni≈øi Nunc,</hi> Whereby hee meaneth, that wee haue no time but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent moment, becau≈øe that the time pa≈øt is already gone, and the time to come is vncertain. <hi>Cicero de ≈øenectute</hi> ≈øayth, What hath a man that hath liued an hundred yeares, but only time lo≈øt, a grieued heart, a weary body, ≈ømal help, a loathing life, a vading credite, and death at his gates? O how well the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle ≈øayth, As long as wee bee in this world, <hi>Peregrinamur ad dominum,</hi> ≈øeeing that by how much the more wee increa≈øe in age, ≈øo much the more vvee decrea≈øe in life. And to ≈øay the truth, to die young, or to die old, is nothing el≈øe but to come to our Inne betimes or late. <hi>Remigius</hi> ≈øayth, The Apo≈øtle doth call vs pilgrimes and ≈øtrangers with great rea≈øon, becau≈øe he ≈øeeth, that we haue no goods in this world, which are proper to our ≈øelues: for if euery man would leaue that which were another bodies, for a certaine he ≈øhould be left very naked. For ≈øayth <hi>Alchimius</hi> the Philo≈øopher, if the ≈øheep ≈øhould take thy garments from thee, the kine thy ≈øhoes, the worms thy ≈øilke, the earth thy linnen, the vines thy wine, the corne thy bread, the trees their fruit, the fountaynes their waters; tell mee I pray thee, of thy ≈øelfe, and by thy ≈øelfe, what ≈øhould≈øt thou haue, what ≈øhoulde≈øt thou be worth or what ≈øhoulde≈øt thou bee able to doe? <hi>Horace</hi> ≈øayth to this purpo≈øe, Be not prowd like a lion, nor exa≈øperate thy ≈øelfe like an ounce: for if euery one would take from thy hou≈øe &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:3666:185"/>that which is his, there would be no liuing creature more ba≈øe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> thou, ≈øeeing that thou ha≈øt neither indu≈øtry to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thy ≈øelfe, nor weapons to defend thy ≈øelfe. Wee haue ≈øaid all this, to proue that if <hi>Tobias</hi> was a pilgrime, wee are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo pilgrimes. But alas alas, hee is accompanied with the good Angel who keepeth him, and we compa≈ø≈øed with a thou≈øand enemies vvhich be≈øiege vs. Doe not wee, trow you, take our voiage be≈øet with a thou≈øand perils, and hindered with as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny troubles, con≈øidering that the deuill doth tempt vs, the fle≈øh mole≈øt and prouoke vs, the world deceiue vs, friends faile vs, our heart ≈øorroweth, our health decaieth, and our life daily ≈øhorteneth? The figure ≈øayth, that as <hi>Tobias</hi> went on his iourney, the fi≈øh came to the bancke to ≈øwallow him vp, whereof in the end hee receiued more profite than feare, in≈øomuch that by the ≈øame fi≈øh, of vvhich hee thought hee ≈øhould haue beene deuoured, his father receiued remedy. What was that great fi≈øh, of which <hi>Tobias</hi> thought he ≈øhould haue been deuoured, but only the ≈øonne of the eternall God vvhen he came to redeeme the vvorld? The fi≈øh vvas bred in the bottome of the riuer, and the ≈øonne of God was borne in the bo≈øome of the eternall Father; and how deepe ≈øoeuer the riuer Tygris vvas, yet the ≈øea of the diuine e≈ø≈øence is farre more deeper. <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> in his booke of the Trinity ≈øayth, Wilt thou ≈øee how much more deeper the eternity of the Father and of his ≈øonne is, than the ≈øea? For it is po≈øsible to empty the ≈øea for all his greatne≈ø≈øe, but for the ≈øecrets of the holy Trinity, it is impo≈øsible fully to vnder≈øtand. The fi≈øhe comming out of the vvater droue young <hi>Tobias</hi> into a great feare, but Chri≈øt cau≈øed a greater feare when hee came into the vvorld, ≈øeeing the Angels bowed them≈øelues, the kings adored him, the ≈øtarres vvere changed, the Iewes were moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and the deuils vvere a≈øeard. The feare vvhich the fi≈øh put <hi>Tobias</hi> in, continued but halfe an houre, but the fear which Chri≈øt put the vvorld in, dureth vntill this day: for being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feard and amazed, the Iews and Pagans cannot yet per≈øuade them≈øelues, that Chri≈øt ≈øhould be the God who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> they ≈øhould
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:3666:186"/>beleeue in, and the Lord which ≈øhall iudge them. When that fi≈øh went out of the riuer to the bancke, of two which were there pre≈øent, the one which was the Angel knew him, &amp; the other, which was <hi>Tobias</hi> was afeard: and euen ≈øo in like maner when the ≈øonne of God came downe from heauen vnto the earth, the Synagogue was ≈øcandalized, and the church recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him, in ≈øo much that according vnto old <hi>Simeons</hi> prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, this diuine fi≈øh came to the ≈øhore of the world, for the re≈øurrection of the good, and the ≈øcandale of the wicked. <hi>Praeparauit dominus pi≈øcem grandem vt deglutiret Ionam,</hi> ≈øayth the holy Scripture, <hi>Ionas</hi> 2. As if hee would ≈øay, At the very in≈øtant when the cruell Marriners did ca≈øt the Prophet <hi>Ionas</hi> into the bottome of the ≈øea, immediately our Lord prepared a great fi≈øh, which ≈øwallowed him aliue, and which kept him in his bowels ≈øafe and ≈øound. As before wee met with <hi>Tobias</hi> and his fi≈øh, ≈øo now wee haue lighte vpon <hi>Ionas</hi> and his fi≈øh, whereof the one was greatly afeard, and the other ≈øwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp, by rea≈øon whereof wee mu≈øt ≈øeeke out ≈øome ≈øecret in them, and di≈øcouer ≈øome my≈øtery in the expounding of them. Who≈øe figure doth <hi>Ionas</hi> repre≈øent, but onely the good and godly, and who were the Marriners which threw him into the ≈øea but onely wicked men? Then the Marriners doe ca≈øt <hi>Ionas</hi> into the ≈øea, when the wicked doe per≈øecute and ca≈øt downe the good, becau≈øe there is no greater torment to a naughty man, than to heare a good man prai≈øed in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence. Of all tho≈øe which were in that ≈øhip onely <hi>Ionas</hi> was a holy and vertuous man, as it doth plainly appeare, becau≈øe there was no one which ≈øpake again≈øt the throwing of him into the ≈øea, but were all of one opinion in that fact: for albeit naughty men bee ≈øometime at variance among them≈øelues, yet in doing of mi≈øchiefe they ea≈øily agree in one. O in what greater danger good mens fame and credite is in, among the wicked, than their liues and goods in the deepe ≈øeas which is plainly ≈øeene in that, that men did ca≈øt the holy Prophet <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> from them, and the waters did receiue him into them, <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> vpon holy <hi>Iob</hi> ≈øayth, What ≈øhould become of the good,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:3666:186"/>if God had no care ouer them? What would not naughty men venter to doe with their ≈ømal ≈øhame &amp; le≈ø≈øe con≈øcience, if their power ≈øhould ≈øtretch as far as their malice? If thou wilt ≈øee, my brother, the care that God hath to keepe thee, if thou haue a care to ≈øerue him, thou ≈øhalt ≈øee it in the holy Prophet <hi>Ionas,</hi> in that our Lord had prepared long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a fi≈øh to ≈øaue him, than the Marriners had determined to drowne him. The fi≈øh which did ≈øaue the Propher <hi>Ionas,</hi> did not put him by him, nor on him, nor vnder him, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, and ≈øo kept him ≈øo warily in his entrals, that neither the fi≈øh dur≈øt kill him, nor the waters drowne him. O that thy goodne≈ø≈øe is infinit, &amp; thy charity very great, my good Ie≈øus, ≈øeeing that thou doe≈øt acquit all tho≈øe which the world doth condemne, loue tho≈øe which the world hateth, receiue tho≈øe which he ca≈øteth off, fo≈øter tho≈øe which he ≈øuffereth to peri≈øh, and giue≈øt honour vnto all tho≈øe which the world doth di≈øho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. <hi>Aymon</hi> vpon <hi>Ionas</hi> ≈øaith, The Prophet <hi>Ionas</hi> ≈ølept in the lowe≈øt part of the ≈øhip, &amp; the Marriners did ca≈øt him into the bottome of the ≈øea, &amp; the Whale kept him in the ≈øecrete≈øt part of his bowels; I mean by this, that Chri≈øt dooth put vs in the daintie≈øt part of his bowels: for it is his propertie to keepe tho≈øe in his hart, which loue him from the hart. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ≈øaith, If thou doe put Chri≈øt in thy eies to looke vpon him, he doth put thee in his to looke vpon thee; If thou place him in thy eares to heare him, he doth place thee in his to heare thee; if thou haue him in thy tongue to prai≈øe him, he hath thee in his to honour thee; if thou put him in thy heart to loue him, hee doth put thee in his to loue thee; in≈øomuch that where thou doe≈øt put Chri≈øt, Chri≈øt doth al≈øo in the ≈øame place put thee. Vpon tho≈øe words of the P≈øalme, <hi>Iacta cogitatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> tuu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> in domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> S. <hi>Ba≈øil</hi> ≈øaith. Yeeld thy ≈øelfe, my brother, yeeld thy ≈øelfe to the will of God, goe whither he will direct thee, do that which he commandeth thee, giue him that which he asketh of thee, beleeue him in that which he telleth thee: for as hee pre≈øerued the Prophet <hi>Ionas</hi> in the Whales belly, ≈øo hee will pre≈øerue thee in the dangers of this life.

We doe in this place aduerti≈øe the curious Reader, that he ≈øhall not be able to vnder≈øtand this chapter, if he doe not read the chapter afore going, becau≈øe this figure of <hi>Tobias</hi> vvas there begun, and from thence is cited.

For the better vnder≈øtanding of this place, it is here to bee noted, that it was done by a continuall miracle, that Chri≈øt did neuer ≈øuffer his mo≈øt holy ≈øoule to communicate and impart her glory vnto his body, becau≈øe that if he had not hindered that, his body had not ben pa≈øsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at all.

O how drie was that drie tree vpon which the heauenly fi≈øh hanged, vvho hauing been brought vp in the deepe ≈øea of the diuine e≈ø≈øence, had not there ≈øo much as one drop of water to drinke. What can be pitied more in this life, than for a fi≈øh hauing been brought vp in the water, yet afterward to die for vvant of vvater? <hi>Tobias</hi> fi≈øh was hard by the vvater ≈øide, and yet died vvith thir≈øt, and Chri≈øts fle≈øh vvas coupeled with his holy ≈øoule, and died al≈øo vvith thir≈øt, becau≈øe the eternall Father to giue vs drinke of his water of heauen, killed his owne onely ≈øonne with thir≈øt, and brought him to die vpon the ≈øands of this world. If <hi>Tobias</hi> ≈øhould not haue drawne the fi≈øh to the land, hee could not haue ma≈øtered him: if Chri≈øt had not become man, neither could he haue died, for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoeuer it be naturall for vs to die, yet it is much more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall for God alwaies to liue.

The≈øe words mu≈øt curiou≈øly be expounded: for God to ≈øay, that the ≈øea ≈øhall bee as drie as a ≈øolitary mountaine, and that hee will cut off all the vaines of his cour≈øe throughout all the world, ≈øeemeth to bee a new ≈øpeech, and a thing that was neuer ≈øeene to be beleeued. Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the letter, &amp; ≈øpeaking according vnto the ≈øence of the≈øe words, the eternal Father doth forewarne his precious ≈øonne, that he wil not onely deale with him like one which will not he are him, nor giue him any comfort, but al≈øo, that he will cut off all occa≈øions, whereby hec may any way receiue comfort; in ≈øo much that to make the ≈øea become a de≈øart, is to make of God a true man, and to cut off the vaines of the ≈øea, is to cut off all heauenly con≈øolation.

Con≈øidering that thou didde≈øt turn the ≈øower waters of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath to be ≈øweet, becau≈øe tho≈øe cur≈øed people ≈øhould drinke of them, why wilt thou giue thy precious ≈øonne neither of the ≈øweet nor ≈øowre? O what great encrea≈øing of torments to Chri≈øt are framed in the figure of <hi>Tobias,</hi> ioined with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe≈øie of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> ≈øeeing the one did draw the fi≈øh to the drie land, and the other made a de≈øart of the ≈øea! for vpon that drie tree of the cro≈ø≈øe, Chri≈øt was exceeding drie, ≈øeeing hee could not obtain a little water to drink of, and hee was al≈øo in a great de≈øart, ≈øeeing that hee found not ≈øo much as one friend to comfort him≈øelfe with. The fourth my≈øtery which the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure containeth is, that <hi>Tobias</hi> did open the fi≈øh, and took out his gaule and his heart; both which did him &amp; his afterwards great good, the one for his owne marriage, and the other to cure his fathers blindne≈ø≈øe. It is greatly to be noted, that in all that fi≈øh, <hi>Tobias</hi> found nothing which was not worthy of the keeping, commodious and profitable in curing &amp; ≈øauerous in eating. The be≈øt that euer hath been, or ≈øhall be in the world, was the Creator and Redeemer of the world, who≈øe words were holy, who≈øe doctrine was profitable, who≈øe workes were maruellous, and who≈øe bowels were mo≈øt louing. What did <hi>Tobias</hi> vnto that fi≈øh, that the Iewes did not vnto Chri≈øt? If the fi≈øh was drawne out of the riuer, ≈øo was Chri≈øt from the people; if the fi≈øh was put vpon drie land, ≈øo was Chri≈øt carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto the Mount of Caluary; if the fi≈øh was ≈øtripped, ≈øo was Chri≈øt whipped; if the fi≈øhes throat was cut, Chri≈øt was al≈øo crucified; if the fi≈øh was opened, ≈øo was Chri≈øt pierced with a ≈øpeare; if the fi≈øh was ca≈øt into the fire, ≈øo was Chri≈øt al≈øo ca≈øt into the ≈øepulchre. This which wee haue ≈øaid is but a little in re≈øpect of that which wee will ≈øay, and that is, that the holy catholike Church hath drawne out this ble≈ø≈øed fi≈øhes gaule, with the which hee cureth vs, and heart with the which hee loueth vs, and liuer with the which he pardoneth vs, &amp; bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:3666:190"/>with which hee dooth cheri≈øh vs. O good Ie≈øus, O my ≈øoules health, who hath euer had or who euer ≈øhall haue a more louinge heart than thou to loue vs, or ≈øo ≈øound a liuer to pardon vs, or ≈øo profitable a gaule to cure vs, or ≈øuch tender bowels to cheri≈øh vs? What wilt thou denie me now, or what wilt thou not now giue mee, O my good Ie≈øus, ≈øeeing that for to ≈øhew thy clernency and mercy vpon me, thou art hanged vpon a drie tree, made a dead fi≈øh, opened, drawne and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elled for my ≈øake? What loue can bee compared vnto thy loue, ≈øeeing that for that which touched me, and not for any thing that belonged to thee, thou didde≈øt con≈øent that they ≈øhould open thy heart, and didde≈øt permit them to rend and teare thy bowels? What am I able to giue thee, O good Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus, what can I giue thee, vnle≈ø≈øe it be my heart which is filthy for thine which is cleane, my rotten liuer for thy vvhole one, my bitter gaule for thy ≈øweet one, and my wicked and hurtful bowels for thy mo≈øt louing ones? Which are the greate≈øt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes which are this day in heauen or earth, but the heart, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and bowels, which Chri≈øt left vnto his church? O how happy ≈øhould he be who ≈øhould haue ≈øuch relickes in his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtodie! for hauing thy heart in cu≈øtodie, how coulde≈øt thou chu≈øe but loue me, and hauing thy bowels in keeping, how woulde≈øt thou but pardon me? How is it po≈øsible, O my good Ie≈øus, how is it po≈øsible that there ≈øhould bee any euill thing in thee, vvhen as the church hath thy precious gaule for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke? Since the beginning of the vvorld there hath neuer been any ≈øuch thing ≈øeene or heard, that is, that among the relickes vvhich the church dooth account for the be≈øt, the gaule is one of the mo≈øt precious, becau≈øe that vvithout that bitter gaule, neither the world could haue beene redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, nor the Prince thereof haue beene ouercome. What is the gaule which the church keepeth in her trea≈øure, but only the bitter pa≈øsion which Chri≈øt ≈øuffered? The riche≈øt iewell which the Synagogue had, was the Manna vvhich came from heauen, &amp; the greate≈øt trea≈øure which the church hath, is the gaule and pa≈øsion of Chri≈øt. Betwixt vvhich two
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:3666:190"/>vvhat great difference there is, it is ea≈øily perceiued, becau≈øe that the profite &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>modity of our gaule doth continue vntil this day, &amp; will continue for euer; but the memory of that old Manna is already lo≈øt. O glorious gaule, O happy gaul, which thou good Lord didde≈øt leaue vnto thy catholick church! for if it did kill thee, it did make mee whole, if it gaue thee paine it gaue me glory, if it was gaule vnto thee, it was hony to me, &amp; if thou didde≈øt end thy life vvith it, yet my ≈øoule vvas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed vvith it. Chri≈øts pa≈øsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> vvas bitter gaule vnto Chri≈øt, and yet Chri≈øts death vvas a ≈øweet gaule for the redeeming of all the vvorld: for if vnto him there fell trauell &amp; pain, yet vnto vs there fell re≈øt &amp; quietne≈ø≈øe, if it fell to his lot to ≈øuffer, yet it fell to vs to reioice &amp; be glad, if the ≈øoure fell vnto him, the ≈øweet fell vnto vs, in ≈øo much that hee cho≈øe the gaule for him≈øelfe, and left the hony for vs. <hi>Iurauit patribus dare terrans fluentem lacte &amp; melle,</hi> ≈øaid the Prophet <hi>Moi≈øes</hi> Exod. 13; As if he vvould ≈øay, You ≈øhall well remember, O yee children of I≈ørael, how you did agree vvith our Lord, &amp; he vvith you, &amp; that both of you by oth, that you ≈øhould neuer ≈øerue any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lord but him, and that he would giue you a land vvhich ≈øhould flow milke and hony. Notwith≈øtanding this oth, the children of I≈ørael were ≈øuch naughty periures, that our Lord determined not to giue them a land which ≈øhould flow hony, but which ≈øhould bring them forth gaule, ≈øeeing hee made it batten for to ≈øow in, rugged and rough to trauell in, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthfull to dwell in, vveake in defence, drie to drinke in, and very poore to maintaine it ≈øelfe. God did make a farre better agreement vvith his Church, than vvith the Synagogue: for hee did not ≈øend vs a land vvhich ≈øhould bring forth honey but gaule, and therefore hee commanded vs to doe vvorkes vvhich ≈øhould bee very vnplea≈øant and vn≈øauoury vnto ≈øen≈øualitie, although very conformable and very profitable. Chri≈øt did drinke bitter gaules, and gaue vs of the ≈øame to drinke: for vvhen hee vvas poore, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded vs to bee poore al≈øo, hee vvas per≈øecuted, and commanded vs to ≈øuffer per≈øecution, hee pardoned his iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,

The yoke of the world doth make vs beleeue that he is of hony, and yet he is but of gaule; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwi≈øe the yoke of Chri≈øt dooth threaten vs, that hee is of hony: for immediately as wee bow our heads to carry him, Chri≈øt putteth him≈øelfe on the other ≈øide to helpe vs.</p>

<pb n="378" facs="tcp:3666:192"/>of, and whereof hee complaineth? This ≈øhould not bee his thir≈øt, this ≈øhould not be his anxiety, nor yet his complaint, nor that which he ≈øo feruently de≈øired: for being as he was, ≈øo mighty and great a king, hee wanted neither noble wines to drinke of, nor dainty waters to recreate him≈øelf withal. There were three ce≈øterns of water in Ieru≈øalem; the one at the gate called Salinaria, where all tho≈øe of the citie dranke of, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hard by the Mount Sion, where tho≈øe drank which were out of the city, &amp; the other at the gate of the Temple, where the fle≈øh which was ≈øacrificed was wa≈øhed. Seeing then that there were ≈øo many ce≈øternes in Ieru≈øalem, who could hinder <hi>Dauid</hi> of them, or let him for drinking of that cold water? If he would not drinke of the≈øe waters, becau≈øe they were ≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, had he not the riuer Iordane hard by? Had he not hard by the floud Cedron, which came from the Mount Lybanus? If he de≈øired water of the well, in Syon he had it; if fountaine water, in Bethleem he had it; if wine made of grapes, in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rude he had it; if liquor made of dates, it was brought out of Egypt: ≈øo that if his thir≈øt had been like vnto ours, hee had more meanes to quench it, than that thir≈øt which hee ≈øuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. This is not the thir≈øt which mole≈øted him, nor the griefe which troubled him: for if the thir≈øt which hee endured had proceeded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the heat of the liuer, or of eating of ≈øalt meats, it is not to bee thought that hee would haue enregi≈øtred it in holy P≈øalms. O renowned Prince and mighty king, wilt thou not tell what thy thir≈øt was of? If you will know after what I thir≈øted, where my griefe lay, and what the paine was which I endured, I let you vnder≈øtand, <hi>Qu√≤d ≈øitiuit anima mea ad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um fontem viuum;</hi> and the meaning this, O ≈øorrowfull man that I am and comfortle≈ø≈øe, ≈øeeing that the thir≈øt which I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure proceedeth not of a corrupted liuer, for mine is ≈øound &amp; whole, nor of burnt choller, for there is no ≈øuch thing in me: my thir≈øt is then not that which the body ≈øuffereth, but that which my ≈øorrowfull ≈øoule endureth. The thir≈øt which I ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and the drine≈ø≈øe which I abide is ≈øo hard to bee extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhed, that no liuing creature is able to take it from me, nor any
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:3666:192"/>water to quench it. O happy is the ≈øoule which thir≈øteth after nothing, but after our Lord! for looke what the thir≈øt is which the ≈øoule hath, ≈øuch is the water which ≈øhe ≈øeeketh to mittigate it with. O that this is a diuine ≈øentence which the Prophet doth vtter vnto vs in this place! whereby wee are plainly taught, that the thir≈øt of the ≈øoule is farre different from the thir≈øt of the body, and that the thir≈øt of the ≈øpirit is one, and that of the fle≈øh another, that of the iu≈øt man one, and that of the ≈øinner another, and the heauenly thir≈øt one, and the humane another. Whereby is the thir≈øt of the body quenched, but by drinking? And with what is the thir≈øt of the ≈øoule ≈ølackened, but by contemplation? And with what is the thir≈øt of the ≈øpirit killed, but by ≈øeruing God? And with what is the thir≈øt of the world ea≈øed, but by following the world? And what doth the iu≈øt thir≈øt after, but grace in this world, and glory in the other? And what thir≈øt hath the wicked, but to procure all meanes hee can the cockering of him≈øelfe? The humane thir≈øt is of humane thinges, and the heauenly thir≈øt is of heauenly things; and therevpon it is, that what our intention is which we haue in our hearts, ≈øuch is the thir≈øt which wee ≈øuffer in this world. If our principall intent be to be greater in the world, all our thir≈øt is to climbe high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if to bee richer, then our thir≈øt is in gathering goods toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in≈øomuch that ≈øuch as our thoughts are, ≈øuch are the liues we lead. Tell me, I pray thee, what doth the prowd man hunt after, but to bee of great authority, what doth the enuious man ≈øhoot at, but to throw downe another, what doth the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious man intend, but how to reuenge vpon his enemy, what dooth the glutton follow but dainties for the belly? This is the thir≈øt which the wicked doe ≈øuffer; and that which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee ≈øpoken without teares is, that their life is ≈øooner at an end, than the thir≈øt of their wickedne≈ø≈øe is quenched. S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu≈øtine</hi> vpon the P≈øalms ≈øayth, In great ≈øinners and ob≈øtinate hearts, although the prowd man doe die, yet pride dieth not, although the enuious man die, yet enuy dieth not, although the couetous man die, yet couetou≈øne≈ø≈øe dieth not, although
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:3666:193"/>the carnall man doe die, yet his carnality dieth not, in≈øomuch that the vicious man is dead, before that his vice is at an end. Why, thinke≈øt thou, doe wee ≈øay that the vicious man is dead before his vice is at an end, but becau≈øe that if the time, in the which he ≈øinned, bee ended and pa≈øt, yet his de≈øire of further ≈øinning is not ended. S. <hi>Ierom</hi> ≈øaith, In damned &amp; vnfortunate per≈øons, their torments are therefore infinit, becau≈øe their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øires of ≈øinning were al≈øo infinit, becau≈øe our Lord doth make greater reckoning of that which the hart doth de≈øire, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of that vvhich the hands doe worke. S. <hi>Ba≈øil</hi> vpon the P≈øalmes ≈øayth, O how much more dangerous is the thir≈øt which a naughtie mans heart dooth ≈øuffer, than that vvhich the body doth endure! becau≈øe this is a≈ø≈øuaged vvith a cup of cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but the thir≈øt of the heart is mittigated by adding ≈øinne vnto ≈øinne; and therevpon it is, that if the thir≈øty man take plea≈øure in drinking, the great ≈øinner taketh farre more in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending. Let mee bee no more credited, if I vvere not told of one vvhich had not left onely one vice vntried, nor let pa≈ø≈øe one day wherein hee had not ≈øinned. What ≈øhall vvee thinke of him, but that if hee had alwaies liued, hee vvould alwaies haue ≈øinned? What a remediles thir≈øt ≈øhould he haue after ≈øinne, and vvhat a friend ≈øhould he be of vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked per≈øons, vvho left no ≈øinne vvhich he proued not, nor no day vvherin he offended not? The rich couetous man which vvas in hell, did not complaine of the fire vvhich did burne him, nor of the cold vvhich pinched him, nor of the hunger vvhich hee endured, but of the great thir≈øt which tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, and therefore asked no other fauour of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but that hee would coole and refre≈øh his tongue with a drop of vvater: it was the iu≈øt iudgement of God, that ≈øeeing hee had no other thir≈øt in this world, but of wealth, authority, and power, and trea≈øure, that hee ≈øhould haue an exce≈øsiue thir≈øt in the other, not of wealth and authoritie, but of a bare cup of water.

When <hi>Abraham</hi> had ended the ≈øacrifice of his ≈øonne <hi>I≈øaac,</hi> our Lord did immediately thanke him for it, and when king <hi>Dauid</hi> had ended his adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with <hi>Ber≈øabee,</hi> he complained out of hand: for our Lord is ≈øo farre without di≈øsimulation and malice, that he doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faine him≈øelfe to bee content, nor denie him≈øelfe to bee angry.

What greater iniury could he doe to them, or what greater reproch could hee v≈øe towards them than call them filthy dregs and rotten lees? <hi>Fulgentius</hi> in a Sermon ≈øayth, According vnto the prophecy of <hi>E≈øayas,</hi> Can you, O you I≈øraelites, denie mee that there is any thing left of your Prie≈øthood, of your royall ≈øcepter, of your rich temple, of your ancient kingdome, of your famous people, but the lees which ≈ømell, and the dregs which ≈øtinke? Chri≈øt found very ≈øtinking dregs, in al the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øh Prie≈øthood, ≈øeeing we read of it in the books of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabees, that they gaue not the roome of the high Bi≈øhop vnto him who be≈øt de≈øerued it, but vnto him who bought it for mo≈øt money. The ≈øonne of God found very rotten dregs in the roiall ≈øcepter of Iuda, con≈øidering that it was v≈øurped of the Romanes, and tyrannized by Herods.

What meaneth this, O old <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> what meaneth this? God doth command thee to kill and burne, and ≈øacrifice and offer thy owne ≈øonne, and doe≈øt thou prophecy that our Lord will prouide for a ≈øacrifice farre better than this which thou doe≈øt bring? O high my≈øtery &amp; diuine Sacrament! for the holy man hauing his ≈øonne in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine≈ø≈øe to be ≈øacrificed, the wood prepared to ca≈øt him into, the fire made to burne him, the ≈øword drawne to kill him, and a commandement from God to offer him, yet carele≈øly ≈øaith, that the Lord will prouide another ≈øacrifice. <hi>Abraham</hi> dooth not ≈øpeake here with the Synagogue his mother (for, for her the ≈øacrificing of <hi>I≈øaac</hi> was prepared, which was the figure of a ≈øacrifice) but he ≈øpake with our mother the holy catholicke church, for whom God would prouide another new ≈øacrifice, which was Chri≈øt crucified, in whome all the ≈øacrifices of the law were to end, and the Sacraments of the church take their beginning.

Was it not, think you, an Holocau≈øt, &amp; a great Holocau≈øt which Chri≈øt offered, ≈øeeing there was no ≈øpot in it wherby it ≈øhould be ca≈øt away, nor any me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ber in his body which was not tormented? To come then vnto our purpo≈øe, it is to be noted, that we haue made all this di≈øcour≈øe to proue that in the my≈øtery of this word <hi>Sitio</hi> which
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:3666:201"/>end, becau≈øe that the Iewes did but borrow them vntill our Lord ≈øhould prouide them a ≈øacrifice, which by <hi>Abraham</hi> he promi≈øed vnto all the world. <hi>I≈øidorus</hi> vpon Gene≈øis ≈øayth, The ≈øacrifice which God promi≈øed to ≈øend into the world, ought to bee worthy of him vnto whom it was offered, and profitable vnto him who did offer it; which could not bee by dead calues, and the bloud of goats, and vnplea≈øant liquors, nor yet with bloudy hands. How was it po≈øsible that the ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of time pa≈øt ≈øhould plea≈øe the Lord, or profit the ≈øin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner which did offer them, ≈øeeing their altars did ≈øeeme rather butchers ≈øhambles, than temples of Prie≈øts? <hi>Rabanus</hi> ≈øayth, <hi>Abrahams</hi> ≈øacrifice was profitable vnto him≈øelfe, and hurtfull vnto his ≈øonne, ≈øeeing he ≈øhould there haue lo≈øt his life; and becau≈øe we may know that this is true, the Lord did ordaine that <hi>Abrahams</hi> ≈øword ≈øhould onely threaten his ≈øonne <hi>I≈øaac,</hi> and afterward kil the ≈øon of God. Our Lord ≈øeeing what ≈ømal benefite ≈øhould be gotten by the death of that child, &amp; what griefe it would cau≈øe vnto this old Father, although hee gaue him licen≈øe to draw his ≈øword, yet hee did not con≈øent that it ≈øhould come neere the child; the which our Lord would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue hindered, if the death of that child could haue ben ≈øufficient to redeeme al the world. God the Father was older than <hi>Abraham,</hi> and loued his ≈øonne better than <hi>Abraham</hi> did his: yet notwith≈øtanding all this, ≈øeeing that in that only ≈øacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice did con≈øi≈øt mans ≈øaluation, he con≈øented that they ≈øhould take his life from him. <hi>E≈øichius</hi> vpon <hi>Leuiticus</hi> ≈øayth, That that which <hi>Abraham</hi> did, was only good vnto him≈øelfe alone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe hee did accompli≈øh that which was commanded him; but when he ≈øaid that the Lord would prouide a ≈øacrifice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him≈øelfe, that was profitable vnto all the world, con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that by that prophecie wee were warranted and made ≈øure, that we ≈øhould be redeemed by the ≈øonne of God. <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> ≈øayth, That it is much to be noted, how that all the ≈øacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the old law did proceed from two things only, that is, from the bea≈øts which they did kill, and the fruit which they plucked from trees. Of their bea≈øts they did offer the head
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:3666:201"/>and feet vnto the Lord, the caule, the fle≈øh, and the entralls, and of trees incen≈øe, ≈øtorax, fruit, grapes, aloes, mirrhe, oile, and ≈øweet odours. And God was not content only, that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> ≈øhould offer what plea≈øed him≈øelfe, but onely of that which God in the law comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ded, that is, of bea≈øts that they ≈øhould offer the greate≈øt, of fruits the be≈øt, of perfumes the ≈øweete≈øt, of mettales the riche≈øt, of liquors the mo≈øt excellente. If we beleeue the Philo≈øopher in his book <hi>De animalibus,</hi> The fir≈øt thing that is engendred is the heart, and the la≈øt the gaule: &amp; when a bea≈øt dieth it is contrary; for the fir≈øt thing that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth is the gaule, and the heart the la≈øt thing that dieth. The Commentator ≈øayth, That as the gaule is the la≈øt thing that is ingendred in man ≈øo it is al≈øo the mo≈øt filthie≈øt and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈øt thing that is in him. Of all liquors the wine is the mo≈øt precious, and contrary no liquor wor≈øer than the dregs of ≈øoure corrupted wine. Doe≈øt thou thinke, my brother, that we haue trauelled in vaine in prouing vnto thee, that the gaule is the wor≈øt part of the bea≈øt, and putrified dregs the wor≈øt of liquors? The end why wee haue ≈øpoken all this is, becau≈øe that when the Redeemer of the world was dead with thir≈øt vpon the altar of the cro≈ø≈øe, they gaue him the≈øe two thinges to drinke, that is bitter gaule, which is the la≈øt and wor≈øt part of the bea≈øt, and dregs and vineger which is the wor≈øt of all liquors. S. <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ≈øayth, The pure≈øt, cleare≈øt, and cleane≈øt of the Synagogue was already ended and gone, and turned into vineger and lees, by rea≈øon wherof they gaue Chri≈øt nothing to drinke but gaule &amp; vineger, giuing vs ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to vnder≈øtand, that they did not giue him only that which they had in the Synagogue, but al≈øo that which them≈øelues were. For what was all the Synagogue but ≈øoure vineger, and bitter gaule? It was not without a high my≈øtery that they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered that which they did to Chri≈øt vpon the cro≈ø≈øe: for as the gaule is the la≈øt and the vilde≈øt thing that is in the bea≈øt, ≈øo the Synagogue was now at an end, and at the vvor≈øt of all her life, in ≈øo much that ≈øhee was become nothing els but a gaule of malice, and al≈øo vineger of couetou≈øne≈ø≈øe. Saint

                  <hi>Ierome</hi> ≈øayth, Euen as vineger hath been good wine, becau≈øe it was gathered of the be≈øt of the vine, ≈øo the people of the Iews were ≈øomtimes good, becau≈øe they had good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> among them; in ≈øo much that there is no other meaning in that they gaue Chri≈øt wine mingled with mire, and ≈øoure vineger to drinke, but that the people were now corrupted, and ≈øcar≈øe one good man left among them. How came this hap among you, O you Iewes, that all the wine of your ve≈ø≈øels is become ≈øoure vineger, and all the hony of your hiues turned into bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gaule? Then your wine began to turne into vineger, when you would not receiue Chri≈øt for your Redeemer, and then all your hony turned into gaule, when you did defame his doctrine and bereaue him of his life. The Synagogue ≈øtriketh great pity into my heart, to ≈øee that in time pa≈øt they did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vnto their God ≈øacrifices, Holocau≈øts, and offerings, and afterward gaule and vineger, and dregs, by which cur≈øed and wicked offering, they took away their makers life, &amp; brought their Commonwealth vnto an end.</p>

For the Prophet to ≈øay that the ≈øonne of God ≈ølept vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, and that after he waked and was weary, and found his heart empty, ≈øeemeth a ≈øtrange and a doubtfull thing vnto
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:3666:202"/>pittifull eares. For if it be true that hee ≈øuffered, how was it po≈øsible that he ≈ølept; and if he ≈ølept, how could it be that he ≈øuffered? What is more ≈øtrange vnto torment than ≈øleepe, and what a greater enemy to ≈øleepe than torment? Con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the ≈øonne of God hanged vpon the altar of the cro≈ø≈øe, his feet bare, his hands torne, his ≈øide pierced, his ≈øinews wre≈øted, and his bones put out of ioint, how could it bee that he ≈øhould ≈øleepe or take any re≈øt at all? He who ≈øhould hang vpon the cro≈ø≈øe as Chri≈øt did, that is, weary, wa≈øted, bloudy, nailed, and one ioint drawn from another, would he not haue greater ability and inclination to complaine, than de≈øire of ≈øleepe? The Prophet vttereth foure things in this prophecie, the fir≈øt, that Chri≈øt did awake out of a ≈øleepe and dreame which he ≈ølept, the ≈øecond, that he awaked aweary, the third, that hee awaked thir≈øty, the fourth, that hee found his heart empty. Of all the≈øe foure things, the one doth make vs mo≈øt of all to maruell: for to ≈øay that Chri≈øt was aweary I beleeue it, to ≈øay that he was a thir≈øt I agree vnto it, and that he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all comfort I do al≈øo admit. But to ≈øay that he ≈ølept, there is that which maketh me to wonder, becau≈øe his eternall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did not ≈øend him thither to ≈øleepe, but to redeem all the world. It is much to bee noted in this place, that the famous <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> ≈øayth again≈øt <hi>Manichaeus. Saep√®, imo ≈øaepi≈øsim√® in ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cris literis circum≈øtantiae ≈øcripturarum declarant Scripturam,</hi> as if he would ≈øay, It happeneth oftentimes, that when the Scripture is darke and ob≈øcure, that the circum≈øtances before going and comming after doe declare and explain the ≈øame Scripture, and one Prophet doth declare another, and one text another. This then being ≈øo, it is conuenient for vs to find out in Scripture ≈øome kind of ≈øleepe, and by that we may coniecture and ge≈ø≈øe at the manner of ≈øleeping which the ≈øon of God ≈ølept vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, and al≈øo wee ≈øhall know, when, how, and wherefore Chri≈øt did awake out of his ≈øleepe. <hi>Exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus e≈øt tanquam dormiens dominus, &amp; tanquam potens crapu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latus vino,</hi> ≈øayth the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> P≈øalm 77. as if he would ≈øay, Our Lord did awake out of his dreame like a man that is
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:3666:203"/>≈øleeping, and hee ro≈øe out of that dreame like a man full of power, and like vnto one who had drunke wine. It is a verefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed truth in our Chri≈øtian faith, that God is a pure ≈øpirit, and a ≈øub≈øtance not compounded but ≈øimple, which hath no fle≈øh which may putrifie, nor bones which may be broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, nor hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which may cau≈øe him to eat, nor ≈øtomack to di≈øge≈øt with, nor vapours to a≈øcend and prouoke him to ≈øleepe, nor yeares to make him old. If it bee true that there is no time which can make God old, nor meat which can force him to ≈øleepe, is it not al≈øo true, that his ≈øleepe is otherwi≈øe to be vnder≈øtood than ours, and that he awaketh in another manner than we doe? When the Philo≈øopher ≈øayth, That ≈øleep is the image of death, what el≈øe doth he mean, but that a man which ≈ølee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, is nothing el≈øe but an image of a dead man? Mark well the conditions of a dead man, and thou ≈øhalt find the ≈øame in one which ≈øleepeth: for he who is in his bed a≈øleepe, and hee who is in his graue can neither ≈øpeake, nor heare, nor vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand tho≈øe which call vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> them, nor feele tho≈øe which touch them, nor offend tho≈øe which abu≈øe them, nor complaine on tho≈øe which bla≈øpheme them, nor reuenge on tho≈øe which hurt them. Who will not ≈øay that our Lord dooth not ≈øleepe this kind of ≈øleep, ≈øeeing we ≈øee that in naughty men he doth di≈ø≈øemble their ambition, the bla≈øphemies which they ≈øpeak, the adulteries which they commit, the ince≈øts they go about, and the malice which they thinke? What is ≈øleepe in a man but to haue all his members at re≈øt? And what el≈øe is ≈ølee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in our Lord, but the ≈øu≈øpending of his vengeance and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment? The wicked men thinke, that becau≈øe our Lord doth ≈øuffer them to liue in the world, and not puni≈øh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, that therefore he is a≈øleep, &amp; that he hath no care ouer the things of this world; which is an errour without all doubt: for they mu≈øt know, if they know it not, that that which wee call in a man ≈øleeping, is called in God di≈ø≈øembling. Vpon tho≈øe words of the Prophet, <hi>Dormitauerunt omnes,</hi> S. <hi>Ambro≈øe</hi> ≈øayth, Our Lord doth winke at the naughtine≈ø≈øe of wicked men, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he hath a de≈øire that they ≈øhould ≈øinne, but becau≈øe he
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:3666:203"/>hopeth that they ≈øhould amend, which if they doe not, the Lord awaketh for their wickednes, and laieth his heauy hand ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> is our Lord ≈øeen to awake out of his ≈øleep but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> he laieth his hand ouer the naughty ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, &amp; doth cha≈øti≈øe him for his errour? Euen as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> one will giue another a great blow, the higher he doth lift his hand, the greater ≈øtroke hee doth giue him, in the ≈øelf ≈øame ≈øort, the longer time our Lord doth ≈øtay and wait for the wicked, the more rigorou≈øly and with le≈ø≈øer pity he doth puni≈øh him. Whereof, thinke≈øt thou, doth it proceed, that God doth awake to puni≈øh thy ≈øinne, but becau≈øe he doth ≈øee thee ≈øleepe ≈øo long time in ≈øinne? <hi>I≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> ≈øaith, Wilt thou ≈øee curious reader, that our Lords ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øting him≈øelfe to ≈øleepe, is nothing el≈øe but to di≈ø≈øemble at our faults, and that to awake is nothing el≈øe in him but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to puni≈øh thy ≈øinne; thou maie≈øt perceiue it by that, that as the Prophet had ≈øaid, <hi>Excitatus e≈øt tanquam dormiens,</hi> hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded immediately, <hi>Etpercu≈øsit eos in pectora eorum.</hi> What o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing doth the Prophet ≈øay vnto vs by the≈øe words, but that at the ≈øelfe ≈øame time, houre, and moment, that the Lord did awake out of his ≈øleepe, he did put his rigorous hand ouer the Princes of the Gentiles. Looke well vnto it, my brother, looke well vnto it, and be not deceiued, and if thou think that our Lord is a≈øleepe, &amp; hath no regard of thy doings, take thou heed for it is the temptation of the diuell, and that none of the lea≈øt with the which he doth deceiue the world: for thou wilt one day thinke that the Lord is carele≈ø≈øe, and hee will ≈øend ≈øome grieuous puni≈øhment vpon thee. And thou art now to vnder≈øtand, that there are ≈øo many in thy hou≈øe which will awake him, as thou ha≈øt faults and ≈øinnes in thy ≈øoule. In the hou≈øe of our Lord, who is the waker of his clemency, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our amendment, and who is the waker of his iu≈øtice but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our offence? Vpon tho≈øe words of the P≈øalme, <hi>Ecce non dormitabit,</hi> S. <hi>Barnard</hi> ≈øayth, As the enemy which dooth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn I≈ørael, <hi>Non aormitabit neque dormiet,</hi> ≈øo the Lord who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth I≈ørael, <hi>Neque dormitabit neque dormiet,</hi> and if it ≈øeeme that his clemency is a≈øleepe, when he doth fauour vs, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:3666:204"/>we ≈øhould liue better, and if it ≈øeemeth that hee dooth defer his iu≈øtice, it is becau≈øe we ≈øhould amend. What ≈øhould I≈øay more vnto thee, but look what workes thou doe≈øt, ≈øuch wakers of God thou ha≈øt. If thou be good, thou doe≈øt awake him to doe thee good, if thou bee naught, thou doe≈øt awake him to doe thee hurt: becau≈øe that in the ≈øight of our Lord the fault crieth for puni≈øhment, and goodne≈ø≈øe asketh reward. Ioining then my≈øtery vnto my≈øtery, and Sacrament vnto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, now that wee haue declared how God ≈ølept in the old Te≈øtament, it is rea≈øon that wee declare al≈øo how his ≈øon did ≈øleepe and awake vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, ≈øeeing that there is no le≈ø≈øe to be wondered at in the ≈øleeping of the ≈øonne, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> there was to be ≈øpoken of in the ≈øleeping of the Father. For to think that the ≈øonne of God did ≈øleepe vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, as one that is weary and in health is woont to doe were a vanity, and al≈øo an here≈øie, for giuing him as they did gaule to eat, and vineger to drinke, there were more rea≈øon that his ≈øtomacke ≈øhould be ready to ouerturne, rather than his head haue any inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ≈øleepe. When <hi>E≈øay</hi> ≈øayth, <hi>Expergefactus la≈øsus,</hi> hee ≈øpeaketh nor of materiall ≈øleepe, but of ≈øpirituall, and if hee ≈øay that Chri≈øt did awake, his powers within him without doubt did not awake, becau≈øe they were broken with torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ts but tho≈øe powers did awake which lie hidden within him. And although the Apo≈øtle doe ≈øay, <hi>Qu√≤d ex ip≈øo, &amp; in ip≈øo, &amp; per ip≈øum ≈øunt omnia,</hi> to wit, of him, in him, and by him all things are, yet there are ≈øixe principall things aboue the re≈øt in him. The≈øe ≈øixe are, his e≈ø≈øence, his power, his wi≈øedome, his humane fle≈øh, his patience, and his clemency, and of the≈øe ≈øixe excellences and graces, three of them ≈ølept, when the ≈øonne of God ≈øuffered, and the other three alwaies watched. His pure and diuine e≈ø≈øence ≈ølept vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, ≈øeeing hee did not ≈øhew him≈øelfe by it to be an ab≈øolute God, for if hee had ≈øhewed him≈øelfe to haue been onely God and not man, he could neuer haue died vpon the cro≈ø≈øe. His high and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall wi≈øedome ≈ølept vpon the cro≈ø≈øe in his pa≈øsion, ≈øeeing that hee neuer an≈øwered vnto any iniurious word, were it neuer ≈øo
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:3666:204"/>grieuous again≈øt him. <hi>E≈øichius</hi> ≈øayth, Chri≈øt did ≈øuffer that to be done by him on the cro≈ø≈øe, that a ≈øheepe doth by him≈øelfe in the butchery, for if the ≈øonne of God ≈øhould haue ≈øhowne before <hi>Pilate</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> any ≈øparke of his wi≈ødome, the Iews had neuer been able to haue put him to death. His in≈øpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and incomparable power did al≈øo ≈øleep in his pa≈øsion vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, not reuenging at all on his enemies, for if it would haue plea≈øed him to haue v≈øed it, in le≈ø≈øe than a moment, hell would haue ≈øwallowed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> all aliue. Now that wee haue told what three powers ≈ølept with Chri≈øt on the cro≈ø≈øe, it is al≈øo conuenient for vs to ≈øhew what three they were which wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with him the ≈øame time. His tender fle≈øh did not ≈øleep at the time of his pa≈øsion vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, which was not one moment at ea≈øe, nor an in≈øtant without torment. How was it po≈øsible that Chri≈øt ≈øhould not bee but awake on the cro≈ø≈øe, ≈øeeing that there was no vaine in his holybody which did not bleed, nor no part of his fle≈øh which was not bru≈øed, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten blacke and blew? His incomparable patience did watch and not ≈øleepe vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, the which our ble≈ø≈øed Ie≈øus did neuer lo≈øe, ≈øeeing that he neuer ≈øpake iniurious word vnto his enemies, nor neuer ≈øhewed them an angry countenance? <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> ≈øayth, All deuout per≈øons ought to follow Chri≈øt in the vertue of ≈øuffering, for be≈øides that the vertue of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is meritotious before God, ≈øhee is al≈øo an occa≈øion of great quietne≈ø≈øe in mans life. Chri≈øts diuine and louing cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency did al≈øo watch, and not ≈øleep in his pa≈øsion, the vvhich he did ≈øhew vvhen hee pardoned his enemies, and praied for his malefactors. O infinite goodne≈ø≈øe, O in≈øpeakable pitie, O my good Ie≈øus, for if vve ≈øhould grant that all the other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues ≈øhould haue ≈ølept on the cro≈ø≈øe, yet thy clemency vvould neuer haue giuen ouer vvatching, for it is farre ea≈øier for the ≈øonne to lo≈øe his light, than for thee not to forgiue and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Apothegms ≈øayth, That the Emperor <hi>Titus</hi> on a time gaue a great ≈øigh and ≈øaid, <hi>Diem ami≈øimus ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci,</hi> as if he vvould ≈øay, It is not rea≈øon that this day ≈øhould be
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:3666:205"/>reckoned among the daies of my life, ≈øeeing that I haue done no good, nor v≈øed any liberality in it. This ≈øpeech was ≈øpread throughout all the world, &amp; much commended of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo≈øophers, and worthy of ≈øo high a Prince. That which the Emperour <hi>Titus</hi> ≈øpake of his franckne≈ø≈øe, Chri≈øt might farre better haue ≈øpoken of his infinite clemency, for if the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour did let no day pa≈ø≈øe in the which he did not ≈øome good, neither did Chri≈øt let ≈ølip any houre or moment wherein hee did not pardon ≈øome offence. And becau≈øe the Prophet ≈øaith that the ≈øonne of God did not onely ≈øleepe, but al≈øo that he did awake, let vs now ≈øee how the≈øe three powers did awake in Chri≈øt, and when, and for what cau≈øe. His incomparable &amp; diuine e≈ø≈øence did ri≈øe and awake when he ≈øpake that terrible word at the time that his ≈øoule was drawne out of him, and therevpon as it were in a traunce and a maze, the great Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion ≈øaid of Chri≈øt, That this was the ≈øon of the true God. Chri≈øt did al≈øo awake his high wi≈ødome vpon the cro≈ø≈øe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> he ≈øpake tho≈øe ≈øeuen wordes in the la≈øt houre of his death, in the which there is contained more profound, and deepe ≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and knowledge, than is in all humane Philo≈øophy or knowledge. Chri≈øt did al≈øo awake his incomparable power, when hee made the ≈øunne to be darkened, the earth to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and quake, the graues to open, and the dead to ri≈øe again.

The angui≈øhes which Chri≈øt ≈øuffered in his mind were innumerable, and the griefes which hee endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his body were intollerable, and that which is mo≈øt of all to be meruelled at is, that his torments being ≈øo many and ≈øo ≈øharpe as they were, yet he complained of none of them on the cro≈ø≈øe, but only of the thir≈øt which he endured. Saint <hi>Barnard</hi> ≈øayth, O good Ie≈øus, O redeemer of my ≈øoule, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ≈øo many things to complaine on, doe≈øt thou onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of thir≈øt? Thy ≈øhoulders are naked and whipped, thy hands broken, thy head bleeding, thy fle≈øh bru≈øed, and yet doe≈øt thou complaine on nothing, but of the thir≈øt which troubleth thee, and of want of water? Doe≈øt thou complain that thou art thir≈øty, and not that thou art bloudy? ha≈øt thou not greater want of thy bloud, than of water? Seeing the bloud which runneth from thy head, doth bath thy face, &amp; wet thy tongue, why doe≈øt thou aske againe for water? For a quarter of an houre that thou ha≈øt to liue, doe≈øt thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine that thou wante≈øt water? O that the thir≈øt which I ≈øuffer ≈øaith Chri≈øt, is not to drinke wine or water, but to ≈øee your amendment, and carry you with mee to my glory, for
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:3666:206"/>≈øeeing that I am now taking my iourney to heauen. I haue a great thir≈øt to take my elect with mee. The thir≈øt which I haue, &amp; the drine≈ø≈øe which I endure, is not ≈øo much to drink any liquor, as to redeem you and ≈øaue you, and reconcile you with my Father, and therefore if thou haue no pitty on mee, yet at the lea≈øt take ≈øome on thy ≈øelfe. O that I had rather, that thou hadde≈øt ≈øome pitty on thy ≈øelfe, than on mee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe it is a greater griefe to ≈øee thee lo≈øt, than to ≈øee my ≈øelf ≈øuffer. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> ≈øayth, Thou didde≈øt adde vnto all thy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øhes, this word <hi>Sitio,</hi> ≈øhewing thereby ≈øuch a great thir≈øt, and repre≈øenting outwardly the exceeding loue that thou didde≈øt beare me inwardly, and vn≈øpeakable charity, which cau≈øed thee to make but ≈ømall account of all that thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de≈øt ≈øuffer in re≈øpect of that de≈øire which thou hadde≈øt to ≈øuffer. And he ≈øayth further, O my good Ie≈øus, I know well that thy thir≈øt is not for thy ≈øelfe, but for me, and this thy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øh is for no other cau≈øe, but for the ≈øaluation of my ≈øoule: and when thou ≈øaie≈øt that thou ha≈øt a de≈øire to drinke, that is as much to ≈øay, as to ≈øuffer more for mee, in ≈øo much that the care that thou ha≈øt ouer me is ≈øo great, that by meanes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thou doe≈øt wholly forget thy ≈øelfe. What meaneth this O redeemer of my ≈øoule, what meaneth this? Thy ioints be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing loo≈øed one from another, thy eies broken, thy mother ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her farewell, and hauing complained on thy Father, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt thou ≈øay anew I am a thir≈øt? What pitty may be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto this, or what goodne≈ø≈øe equall vnto this Oredee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of my ≈øoule. Wee ≈øee by this word <hi>Sitio,</hi> that death was ≈øufficient to take all thy dolors and griefes from thee, and yet that it was not inough to cut off the loue which thou hadde≈øt to redeeme vs. Who is able to ≈øay truly, that thy loue did end vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, con≈øidering that for the loue of thy elect thou didde≈øt yet thir≈øt after more griefes and angui≈øhes? All this Saint <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> ≈øpake. <hi>Chri≈øo≈øtome</hi> ≈øayth, When the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall word ≈øaid vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, I am a thir≈øt, I doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that hee did ≈øo much aske for water to drinke, as hee did aske for time of his Father to ≈øuffer more griefe and
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:3666:206"/>torment. For as the candle when it is going out doth ca≈øt the greate≈øt light, ≈øo Chri≈øt the more his death drew neere, the more his loue and charity doth kindle towards vs. <hi>Remigius</hi> vpon Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> ≈øayth, Although the diuine prouidence did reduce all the trauailes of his life vnto three yeares, and that al≈øo hee brought all the torments of the cro≈ø≈øe vnto three houres, yet it is not to bee beleeued, that Chri≈øt his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite charity was contented with this ≈øhort time, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I thinke for my owne part, that the thir≈øt which hee ≈øhewed vpon the tree vvas not ≈øo much to drinke of any wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the riuer, as to declare and make manife≈øt his loue vnto the world. <hi>Fulgentius</hi> in a Sermon ≈øayth, The ≈øonne of God did thinke, that ≈øeeing his Father had not giuen him charity by waight, ≈øo hee ≈øhould not giue him torment by mea≈øure, by rea≈øon whereof hee cried aloud on the cro≈ø≈øe <hi>Sitio,</hi> to let vs vnder≈øtand by this thir≈øt, that ≈øeeing the gifts which hee receiued had no end, that the torments likewi≈øe which he receiued ≈øhould not be limitted.</p>

I had ≈øcar≈øely ≈øpoken the word <hi>Sitio,</hi> but they gaue mee gaule to eat, and vineger to drinke. There is much matter to bee ≈øpoken vpon this, that is, what drinke they gaue him when they gaue it him, where they gaue it him, why they gaue it
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:3666:207"/>him, in what they gaue it him, and how quickly they gaue it him. The drinke which they gaue him was gaule and vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the place where was vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, the time was when hee was yeelding vp the gho≈øt, the cau≈øe why was to helpe him to die, they gaue it him in a reed and a ≈øpunge, and that pre≈øently when he had thir≈øt; ≈øo that all the≈øe circum≈øtances doe aggrauate the fault in them. Wee find that the diuell made two banquets in this world, the one in the terre≈øtriall paradi≈øe vnto our Father, where he gaue him the fruit of the tree to eat; the other to Chri≈øt in the de≈øert, where he inuited him to ≈øtones of the field, the which might haue ben ground, ≈øifted and ≈øo mingled, that they might haue been eaten. The Iewes gaue Chri≈øt wor≈øer meat, than the diuell offered him in the de≈øart, for they gaue him gaule to eat, and vineger to drinke, which are bitter and ≈øoure, horrible in ta≈øt, and mortal in eating. For as the Philo≈øopher ≈øayth, The true≈øt loue is the loue of children, the ≈ømell of ≈ømels is of bread, the ≈øauor of ≈øauors is of ≈øalt, the ≈øweete≈øt of all ≈øweetes is of hony, and the bittere≈øt of all bitters is of gaule. For what is there vnder heauen ≈øweeter than hony, or more bitter than gaule? For what ≈øtomacke is there in the world ≈øo ≈øtrong, who after a cup of gaule and vineger would not either bur≈øt or die? <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus</hi> vpon S. <hi>Luke</hi> ≈øayth, If the Iewes had remembred that his Father gaue them fre≈øh water in the de≈øart to drinke of, and bread from heauen to eat of, and that his ≈øonne likewi≈øe gaue fiue thou≈øand of them fi≈øh their fill, and bread vntill they left off it, they would not haue giuen him gaule to eat and vineger to drinke. <hi>Dama≈øcenus</hi> ≈øayth, That it is proper to naughty men to be very ≈øparing in matters of vertue, and in matters of vice very laui≈øh, which doth ea≈øily appear in Chri≈øt, for he asking for nothing but drink, they gaue him al≈øo ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to eat. <hi>An≈øelmus</hi> ≈øayth, That the abundance of malice, and the want of con≈øcience made the Iewes put that bitter gaule to Chri≈øts mouth, which other men do loath to touch. The Iewes did al≈øo ≈øhew the depth of their wicked, naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe in giuing Chri≈øt that horrible drinke, being as hee was
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:3666:207"/>≈øo neere death vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, becau≈øe that all men are wont in that extremity, bee they friends or enemies, to helpe him who is in torment to die well, and no man in that houre dare to trouble or vexe him. <hi>Origen</hi> ≈øayth, That it is a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtome among ≈øauage and barbarous men, that ≈øuch as were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies in their life time, doe reconcile them≈øelues, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don one another in death, Becau≈øe as <hi>Plato</hi> ≈øayth, Death a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone doth end all trauaile and all anger. This generall rule failed only in the Iewes, as men which were more barbarous and inhumane than all other, who at the very time that Chri≈øt was yeelding vp his ≈øpirit, did ≈øpet vpon him, bla≈øphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him with their tongues, hated him with their hearts, &amp; tormented him with gaule and vineger. King <hi>Dauid</hi> and king <hi>Saul</hi> were mortal enemies, but when the Phili≈øtims had ≈ølain <hi>Saul</hi> in the hils of Gelboe, they ≈øaw <hi>Dauid</hi> weepe bitterly for him, and cau≈øed him to bee buried with great care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. All writers doe affirme, that there were not greater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies in all Greece than <hi>Demo≈øthenes</hi> the Philo≈øopher, and <hi>E≈øchines</hi> the Orator, but when <hi>E≈øchines</hi> vnder≈øtood in Rhodes that <hi>Demo≈øthenes</hi> his enemy was dead in Athens, he did not only weepe many teares for him, but did al≈øo be≈øtow ≈øumptuous funerals vpon him. The great hatred and warres which were betwixt <hi>Iulius Cae≈øar</hi> and <hi>Pempeius</hi> the great, are knowne vnto all the world, yet neuerthele≈ø≈øe when pittifull <hi>Ca≈øar</hi> had <hi>Pompeius</hi> head in his hands, hee ≈øpake many pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full words in his fauour, and ≈øhed many teares ouer his head. <hi>Cyrillus</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ≈øayth, That there was neuer read of the like hatred as the Iews bare Chri≈øt, ≈øeeing that although they ≈øaw his breath going out of his body, yet they gaue him gaule to eat, and vineger to drinke, becau≈øe that as they had tormented his outward members with torments, they might al≈øo poy≈øon his inward bowels with griefe and paine. S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> ≈øayth, It is not credible that the wicked Iews had mens hearts in them, but the hearts of ≈øome madde dogges, ≈øeeing that the more the ≈øonne of God did draw neere vnto death, the more they did waxe cruell, becau≈øe that the end why
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:3666:208"/>they gaue him gaule and vineger, was becau≈øe hee ≈øhould die ≈øooner and al≈øo raging. If as it did plea≈øe Chri≈øt onely to ta≈øt of that drinke, it had been his will to haue drunke it all, con≈øidering how there was no bloud left in his vaines, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo his weakene≈ø≈øe at that time, it is no doubt but it would haue ≈øhortened his life, and put him to a more painfull death. O that this doctor ≈øaid very well, that they had not mens hearts in them, for otherwi≈øe, con≈øidering the extremity they ≈øaw him in, they could not haue done le≈ø≈øe than haue giuen him ≈øome wine to drinke, or water to refre≈øh him, or v≈øed ≈øome words of comfort. O pittifull ca≈øe, and vn≈øpeakable cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, ≈øeeing that at the houre of thy death, thou hadde≈øt no friend to encourage thee, no drop of water to refre≈øh thee, but onely a little gaule for thy breakefa≈øt, and a little vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to drie thy mouth with. Let not mee v≈øe then any deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate meates, and let all ≈øuperfluous diet bee farre from mee, for ≈øeeing my God and Lord doth neither eat nor drinke but gaule and vineger, from euening to euening, how dare I fare daintely at ≈øet meales?

Seeing that thou, O my good Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus, hadde≈øt thy mouth poy≈øoned with gaule, and wet with vineger? O ≈øacred mouth, O holy tongue, who is ≈øo wicked, as to dare bath that mouth with gaule and vineger, hauing preached with the ≈øame ≈øo many Sermons, giuen ≈øo many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly le≈ø≈øons, taught ≈øo many people, and done ≈øo many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles? You ≈øhould put gaule and vineger, O yee cur≈øed Iewes, vpon this my mouth, which is neuer opened but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, and vpon my tongue which can doe nothing but lie, for as for that of your Creator and our Redeemer, what ≈øinue was there that hee did not tell you of, and what vertue is there that hee did not teach you? Saint <hi>Barnard</hi> ≈øayth, O what great difference there is betwixt mouth and mouth, tongue and tongue? For mans tongue ≈øaid vnto <hi>Pilat, cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fige eum,</hi> &amp; Chri≈øts tongue ≈øaid vnto his Father, <hi>Ne≈øciunt quid faciunt.</hi> In ≈øo much, that the peoples whole drift was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Pilate</hi> to kill him, and Chri≈øts whole intention was, to

And to the ≈øame purpo≈øe God ≈øpake by the Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> when hee ≈øaid, <hi>Iudicium contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham tecum,</hi> as if hee would ≈øay, I will O I≈øraell, that thou and I, and I and thou, ≈øit down to iudge, and take an arbitrator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt vs, to the end, that both parts being hard, he may iudge what ≈ømall rea≈øon thou ha≈øt to offend me, &amp; what great cau≈øe I haue to complaine on thee. O infinit goodne≈ø≈øe, O vn≈øpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able clemency of thee my great God, what creature can iu≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øay, that thou ha≈øt condemned him without iu≈øtice, ≈øeeing thou doe≈øt fir≈øt ≈øit downe to verifie thy iu≈øtice? O vnto how many may God iu≈øtly ≈øay at this day, what can I doe more for thee than I haue done, and wherein can≈øt thou offend me more than thou ha≈øt offended me? O good Ie≈øus, O light and glory of my ≈øoule, what ≈øhoulde≈øt thou doe more for me than create me, or what coulde≈øt thou doe more for me than redeeme mee? Thy goodne≈ø≈øe and my wickednes do ≈øtriue before thy face, and thy grace and my offence, thy bountie and my vngratefulne≈ø≈øe, thy mercy and mine ob≈øtinacy, thy pardon and my ≈øinne: in ≈øo much, that I neuer cea≈øe to ≈øinne, and thou neuer to di≈ø≈øemble it. But to ≈øpeake more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, it is to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>≈øidered, that our God was not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem all of vs in general, but he did al≈øo ≈øatisfie for our ≈øins in particular, laying vpon him≈øelf a particular pain which ≈øhould an≈øwere vnto our particular offence. Chri≈øt ≈øatisfied for the ≈øinne of pride when hee tooke mans fle≈øh vpon him, vnto
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:3666:209"/>which humility there can no vertue of any Saint be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, becau≈øe he made him≈øelfe of God a man, of eternall tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, of one that was immortall mortal. <hi>Barnard</hi> ≈øayth, That of all tho≈øe which were proud, <hi>Lucifer</hi> was the greate≈øt, of all gluttons <hi>Adam,</hi> of all Traitors <hi>Iudas,</hi> of all patient men <hi>Iob,</hi> and of all humble men Chri≈øt exceeded all. Chri≈øt ≈øatisfied for fornication by his circumci≈øion, and therevpon it is, that becau≈øe the ≈øinne of lechery is that ≈øinne, into which men do ea≈øilie≈øt and mo≈øt oftene≈øt fall into, our Lords plea≈øure was to redeeme it with his precious bloud. Chri≈øt ≈øatisfied for the ≈øinne of enuy with his incomparable pouerty, which hee ≈øo ≈øtreitly kept, that hee had neither hou≈øe to dwell in, nor a penny to ≈øpend, nor wealth to liue by. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ≈øayth, That the end of Chri≈øts pouerty was, to withdraw from him≈øelfe things nece≈ø≈øary, becau≈øe we ≈øhould leaue off things ≈øuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: for if a Chri≈øtian haue any thing in his hou≈øe which is ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, hee dooth po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe it all as ≈øtolne from the poore. Chri≈øt ≈øatisfied for gluttony by his continuall fa≈øting all his life time, and oftentimes ≈øuffering great hunger; which is ea≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øeene, becau≈øe that after his fa≈øt in the de≈øart he was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a hungred: and al≈øo when he and his di≈øciples did eat eares of corne in the field. S. <hi>Barnard</hi> ≈øayth, Chri≈øt had ≈øuch a great feruour to preach by day, and did contemplate ≈øo continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by night, that although hee had meat, yet he did ≈øcar≈øe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to eat it. Chri≈øt ≈øatisfied for the ≈øinne of anger with his continuall patience, which patience of his was ≈øo perfect that hee neuer knew how to reuenge an iniury, nor neuer v≈øe towards any man an iniurious word. <hi>In patientia ve≈øtra po≈ø≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debilis animaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> vectrarum,</hi> ≈øaid Chri≈øt to his di≈øciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 25. As if hee would ≈øay, The merit and reward of patience is ≈øo great that it maketh him vvho hath it, lord ouer his owne ≈øoule. Many po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe their eares by not hearing of backbiting, and other po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe their eies, not ≈øeeing of vaine things, and others po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe their hands by keeping them from ≈øtealing, &amp; others their tongues by keeping them from bla≈øphemy, but of all the≈øe which I haue ≈øpoken off, doth Chri≈øt ≈øay that any
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:3666:209"/>of them doth po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe his ≈øoule, but only hee who hath pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? What doth it auaile vs to be lords of our feet, hands, and ears, if the diuell do po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe our ≈øoules? What is it to be lord and mai≈øter ouer a mans own ≈øoule, but wholy to ≈øubdue his owne ≈øen≈øuality? <hi>Ambro≈øe</hi> vpon S. <hi>Luke</hi> ≈øayth, He onely hath his will in ≈øubiection, who in trauaile and vexation hath great patience.

Loe then thou ≈øee≈øt it proued, how the ≈øon of God was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to redeeme all the world in generall, but that hee did in particular as it were ≈øatisfie for euery ≈øinne, disburdening eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man of a particular fault, and ca≈øting vpon him≈øelfe a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall paine.</p>

Whereof we may take an example, that we may better ouercome our inui≈øible enemies with ab≈øtinence than with abundance and plenty. Yet ≈øo it was, that notwith≈øtanding the great thir≈øt which <hi>Dauid</hi> had, hee would not drinke one drop of that water, ≈øaying that God forbid that hee ≈øhould drinke of that water which was gotten with the deaths of ≈øo many men, and was bought with ≈øo much bloud. Euery man may take an example to him≈øelfe by this, that no man ≈øhould carry any thing to his hou≈øe gotten with an euill con≈øcience, or by the preiudice of another, for we ≈øee nothing more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon than that men for greedine≈ø≈øe of another mans doe not onely lo≈øe that which was their own by inheritance, but that al≈øo which of other mens they had gotten. Leauing the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and comming to the ≈øpirituall meaning, it doth well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that Chri≈øt is the ≈øonne of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and that <hi>Dauid</hi> is the father of Chri≈øt, ≈øeeing the one was thir≈øty in the field, and the other on the Mount of Caluary, the one ≈øighting, &amp; the other ≈øufiering, the one compa≈ø≈øed with enemies, and the other hanging betweene theeues, the one to drinke a cup of cold water, and the other to redeeme mankind. How farre greater the thir≈øt was which the ≈øonne of God had, than that which <hi>Dauid</hi> had, it is ea≈øily ≈øeene in that, that <hi>Dauid</hi> did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nife≈øt his thir≈øt with words onely, and the ≈øonne of God with words and teares: wherevpon wee may inferre, that his true thir≈øt was not ≈øo much to drinke water of the ce≈øternes, as to ≈øaue ≈øinfull ≈øoules. O that the thir≈øt which Chri≈øt ≈øuffered was of a farre more higher degree than <hi>Dauids</hi> thir≈øt, for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> did but ≈øigh for water, but the ≈øonne of God did not ≈øigh but did ≈øuffer death to redeeme our ≈øoules, and <hi>Dauid</hi> did
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:3666:210"/>quench his thir≈øt with the preiudice of other mens bloud, but the ≈øonne of God did not kil his, but with his own bloud. Chri≈øt had not ≈øo good friends on the Mount of Caluary, as <hi>Dauid</hi> had in his campe, becau≈øe <hi>Dauids</hi> ≈øeruants brought him water to refre≈øh him withall, and Chri≈øts enemies gaue him gaule &amp; vineger to ta≈øt of. <hi>Super vulnera mea addiderunt dolorem,</hi> ≈øaid the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ≈øpeaking in the per≈øon of Chri≈øt, as if hee would ≈øay, The greate≈øt trauaile and griefe which I feele now is, that be≈øides the words &amp; dolours which the Iewes gaue me in crucifieng me, ≈øinners haue now added another dolour vnto my former dolours, which doth grieue me more than all the others did. The dolours which Chri≈øt ≈øuffered in his pa≈øsion, his wounds and thornes cau≈øed them, but the dolour which he now complaineth of, our ≈øinnes doe cau≈øe. And he hath great rea≈øon to complaine more of this than of the others, becau≈øe the wounds which they gaue him and the nailes and thornes which tormented him dured but one day, but the griefe which our offences doe cau≈øe in him doe euery houre offend him. Saint <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> ≈øayth, If there were no fault in vs, there ≈øhould be no wounds in Chri≈øt, and therevpon it ri≈øeth, that wee wound him more in his entrails with our offences, than the Iewes did with their nailes. But ≈øome man may ≈øay that Chri≈øt dooth not ≈øo much complaine by the Prophet of his wounds, as of a grief and dolour which they added aboue all dolours, and therefore it is conuenient that we declare what this dolor is, and how farre it reacheth. For the better vnder≈øtanding of this point we mu≈øt note, that ouer and aboue all the ≈øinnes which we commit we doe adde a new one vnto them, which is as it were a counterpei≈øe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt euery ≈øinne, the which cau≈øeth the ≈øinne to bee more grieuous and le≈ø≈øer hope of amendment in vs. What is this new ≈øinne but the plea≈øure which we take to haue ≈øinned, &amp; the de≈øire which we haue to ≈øinne againe? And becau≈øe wee may not ≈øeeme to ≈øpeake at randome, wee will giue of euery one an example. If the prowd man would be content to bee prowd only, it would be but halfe a fault, but ala≈ø≈øe hee ≈øayth
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:3666:211"/>that he is nothing prowd at all, if wee regard his great de≈øart, by rea≈øon whereof he de≈øireth to be of greater power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and ability to be≈øtow more than hee doth. If the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and impatient man would be content to chide onely, to braue it, and murmure, it might pa≈ø≈øe; but alas hee doth adde fault vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> a fault, that is, he hath a very great thir≈øt &amp; a de≈øire to iniury and mole≈øt his enemies, take their liues from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>, &amp; al≈øo to ran≈øacke and ≈øpoile their goods. If the couetous man could be content with that which were nece≈ø≈øary, and with ≈øomewhat more, it were tollerable; but ala≈ø≈øe, like a noughty Chri≈øtian he heapeth ≈øinne vpon ≈øinne, for be≈øides that hee is not content to ≈øaue bread and drinke, yet hee neuer ceafeth day nor night to hoord vp all hee can. If the carnall man would bee content once to attaine his de≈øire, and that which his ≈øen≈øuality requireth, it might be di≈ø≈øembled; but ala≈øle hee hath ≈øuch a great thir≈øt to enioy all hee ≈øeeth, that if it were in his power, he would leaue no virgine vndefloured, no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried woman not diffamed, nor any widdow not deceiued. If the ≈ølothfull man would bee content him≈øelfe not to goe in the cold in the Winter, nor into the head in Summer, but would eat without any labour of his owne, and ≈øleepe in his bed without care, we would not much care if he did it; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la≈ø≈øe, hee hath ≈øuch a great de≈øire of ea≈øe, and is ≈øuch an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to labour, that hee de≈øireth nothing, but that his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ≈øhould take paine, becau≈øe hee might eat, and that all they ≈øhould watch becau≈øe hee might ≈øleepe. If the glutton would be content to eat till he were fill, and ≈øometimes vntill hee belked, wee would not ≈øo much regard it; but ala≈ø≈øe hee hath ≈øuch a great de≈øire to eat daily of exqui≈øite meats, and drinke wines of great price, that if it were po≈øsible, there ≈øhould bee no fi≈øh in the ≈øea which hee would not eat of, nor no meat on earth which he would not ta≈øt. Loe then this is the dolour which Chri≈øt complaineth on, when he ≈øayth, <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vulnera mea addiderunt dolore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>,</hi> which did ≈øo much grieue him that he felt none more, for Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> ≈øayth, That God doth not looke what we be, but what we de≈øire to bee.
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:3666:211"/>What greater wickedne≈ø≈øe, or what greater naughtine≈ø≈øe can there be in the world than not to be content to be naught, but to de≈øire to be more naught. <hi>Ca≈øsiodorus</hi> ≈øayth, That the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences which wee commit are the wounds which wee giue Chri≈øt, and the dolour which we adde vnto the≈øe wounds, is the de≈øire which we haue to ≈øinne more and more. This cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed de≈øire and wicked thir≈øt of adding ≈øinne vnto ≈øinne, is al≈øo paied for and ≈øatisfied for the iu≈øt which come vnto our Lord when he ≈øaid aloud on the cro≈ø≈øe, that he had a de≈øire to ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer more, as the wicked had to ≈øinne more.

O my ≈øoule, O my heart, doe you not ≈øee that your thir≈øt of ≈øinning more and more is cured with his thir≈øt of ≈øuffering, and that your thir≈øt of heaping one ≈øinne vpon another, is quenched by Chri≈øts thir≈øt of adding one pain vnto another? <hi>Quod facis fac citius,</hi> ≈øaid Chri≈øt to <hi>Iudas</hi> in the night of the la≈øt ≈øupper, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13, as if he would ≈øay, Seeing that thou wa≈øt ≈øo ≈øhamele≈ø≈øe as to ≈øell me ye≈øterday, and art determined to deliuer mee this night vnto my enemies, make an end of thy ≈øupper and ri≈øe from thence, and doe that which thou wilt doe quickly, becau≈øe that the end of thy perdition ≈øhall bee the beginning of my redemption. O ≈øorrowfull ≈øpeech, O heauy word which Chri≈øt ≈øpake vnto the vnhappy di≈øciple, becau≈øe that thereby he is permitted to doe what he would, as though he ≈øhould giue him licence vtterly to de≈øtroy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe, and that there ≈øhould bee no hope of his amendment. What other meaning had tho≈øe wordes which our holy mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter ≈øpake vnto the reprobate di≈øciple, that is, Do that which thou ha≈øt to doe with ≈øpeed; but to declare by tho≈øe words, that he had for≈øaken him, and that hee will defend him no more with his holy hand? and yet in this lamentable ≈øpeech,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:3666:212"/>Chri≈øt v≈øed great clemency toward <hi>Iudas,</hi> for when hee ≈øaid, Doe ≈øpeedily that which thou wilt do; it was to ≈øay, deliuer me quickly, and die thou quickly: for how much the older thou doe≈øt grow in yeares, by ≈øo much the more thou wilt grow in offences. God of his mercy keep vs from this licence or permi≈øsion, for it is a great ≈øigne that this man is already fore≈øeene to be damned, whome our Lord doth permit to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne to be naught pre≈øently.

Wee haue ≈øpoken all this, by rea≈øon of
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:3666:212"/>the gaule and vineger vvhich the Iewes gaue Chri≈øt, for it is a vvonder to thinke vvith vvhat ≈øpeed they ≈øought it out, &amp; vvhat diligence they v≈øed in giuing him it, for ≈øurely if the Scripture did not a≈ø≈øure vs of it, it would ≈øeeme but a dreame to ≈øay that they ≈øhould haue all thinges ≈øo readily &amp; at hand as they gaue him. Is it not a thing much to be vvondered at, that the Iewes being out of the towne, and in open field, as ≈øoone as he had ≈øaid <hi>Sitio,</hi> that they ≈øhould pre≈øently haue at that place, ≈øoure vineger, bitter mirrhe, poi≈øoned gaule, vn≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uory i≈øope, and a ≈øpunge to drinke it in, and a reed to reach it him? If a man ≈øhould haue gone into the towne to ≈øeeke all the≈øe ≈øixe things, hee would haue been ≈øixe houres a getting them: For he mu≈øt haue gone to the butchery for the gaule, to the Apothecary for the mirrhe, to another place for the vineger, to a ≈øhop for the ≈øpunge, to a garden for I≈øope, and to the riuer for a reed. But vvhen Chri≈øt ≈øaid vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, I am a thir≈øt, they did not ≈øtay ≈øixe houres to ≈øeek the≈øe things, but they did reach them him pre≈øently all at once, kept, and hidden ready for him: for if his ≈øoule vvould not haue for≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him vvith the torment of the nailes, ≈øhee vvould haue for≈øaken him by the force of that drinke.</p>
               <p>The ≈øame leaue that Chri≈øt gaue <hi>Iudas,</hi> it ≈øeemeth that he gaue it al≈øo vnto the Iewes, that is, that they ≈øhould doe by him vvhat they vvould, and how they vvould, and as ≈øpeedily as they vvould, vvhich liberty they v≈øed vvith the aduantage, ≈øeeing that in ≈øhort ≈øpace they vvatched him with their eies, dogged him vvith their feet, laid hold on him with their hands, bla≈øphemed him vvith their tongues, hated him vvith their hearts, and ended his life vvith their drinkes. The naughty Iewes vvent to the Mount of Caluary, and there vvent al≈øo old <hi>Io≈øeph</hi> and <hi>Nichodemus,</hi> but their intentions were farre different the one from the other, the holy men carried pin≈øers vvith them to pull out the nailes, ladders to take him downe from the cro≈ø≈øe, ointments to annoint him vvith, a ≈øheet to wind him in, and a ≈øhrowd to bury him in. <hi>Non ≈øic, impij non ≈øic,</hi> The wicked did not go ≈øo, but to go their

What man is there this day in the world ≈øo noble in birth, or ≈øo rich in wealth, but if he proclaime publickely, that hee will burne both man and woman, but they wil pre≈øently lay hands on him, &amp; bind him hand &amp; foot, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>demn him for want of di≈øcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>?

Vpon tho≈øe wordes, <hi>Non veni mittere pacem ≈øed gladium,</hi> S. <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> ≈øayth, If wee will well vnder≈øtand, that which Chri≈øt ≈øayth in this place, we ≈øhould not only not bee ≈øcandalized at it, but al≈øo highly thanke him for it: for to ≈øay the truth, with that fire he doth ≈øeare our dead fle≈øh, and with that knife he doth let out our corrupt bloud. <hi>Beda</hi> vpon the Apo≈øtle ≈øayth. What is the ≈øire which Chri≈øt brought from heauen into the world but his exceeding great loue?
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:3666:215"/>The quality of this high fire is, to heat and not burne, to giue light and not hurt, to burne and not con≈øume, to putrifie and not wa≈øt, to warme and not to grieue. O good Ie≈øus, and light of my ≈øoule, what ≈øen≈øuality can ouercome mee, or what ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation can throw mee downe, if at the coales of thy fire I warme my ≈øelfe, and giue my ≈øelfe light with the flame of thy loue? What can hee doe, what is in him, or what regard is there of him in this life, who doth not warme him≈øelfe at the fire of thy loue? What made S. <hi>Andrew</hi> goe cheerfully and ≈øinging to be crucified, but the fire of the loue which burned in him? What made S. <hi>Agnes</hi> goe more ioifully to martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome than a new married ≈øpou≈øe to bed, but the fire of thy diuine loue which ≈øhined in her? What made tho≈øe ≈øtones ≈øeeme vnto S. <hi>Steuen</hi> hony comoes, but that holy loue which burned in his ≈øoule? <hi>Iguis erat &amp; calefaciebat ≈øe.</hi> O vvhat a difference there is betwixt the fire which Chri≈øt brought downe from heauen, and the fire which <hi>Cayphas</hi> hath in his pallace. For S. <hi>Peter</hi> warming him≈øelfe at it, of a Chri≈øtian became a Pagan, &amp; S. <hi>Paule</hi> warming him≈øelf at Chri≈øts fire, of a Pagan became a Chri≈øtian. God ≈øend me of Chri≈øts fire, ≈øeeing it doth make me know him, and God keep <hi>Cayphas</hi> fire from me, ≈øeeing it doth make me denie him. For if S. <hi>Peter</hi> had not warmed him≈øelfe at <hi>Cayphas</hi> fire, the wench would not haue importuned him, nor he denied Chri≈øt, not haue lo≈øt the confe≈øsion of the catholicke faith. The Euangeli≈øt ≈øayth that, <hi>Petrus calefaciebat ≈øe,</hi> that is, That <hi>Peter</hi> did warm him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe at the fire, but he ≈øayth not that the fire was able to take his cold from him, and therefore the fire which the world hath for her worldlings is ≈øuch, that they are but few vvhich warme them≈øelues at it, but many which waxe cold by it. S. <hi>Peter</hi> being from the fire ≈øaid vnto Chri≈øt, <hi>Tecum paraui iam in mortem me,</hi> and by the fire he ≈øaid, <hi>Non noui heminem,</hi> in ≈øo much that being at ≈øupper with Chri≈øt he did burne, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Cayphas</hi> fire he was a cold.

<pb n="425" facs="tcp:3666:215"/>comfort, nor flame which could giue light, nor any thing which might content, he brought from heauen with him the fire of his holy loue, with the which wee ≈øhould all be enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, all lightened, and all contented. The ≈øon of God would neuer haue ≈øaid, I came to put fire on earth, if hee had ≈øeene that there had been the true fire of his loue vpon the earth, but ≈øeeing that the fire of the world doth burn and not heat, hurt and giue no light, wa≈øt and not burne, grieue and not cheere, burn and not purifie, ≈ømoke and not ≈øhine, he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred to bring a fire which ≈øhould heat all the world. Woe be vnto him which will not warme him≈øelfe at this fire, and woe be to him who will not receiue light at the flames of his loue, becau≈øe that the only perfection of our ≈øaluation dooth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt in offering our ≈øelues to God, and in louing him with all our heart. It is much to be noted, that Chri≈øt brought at one time fire to burn, &amp; a ≈øword to cut me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>s throats, ≈øeeing he ≈øaith, <hi>Ignem veni mittere in terram,</hi> and al≈øo, <hi>Non veni pacem mittere ≈øed gladium,</hi> to let vs vnder≈øtand, that hee brought fire with him, with the which his elect ≈øhould ≈øerue him with loue, &amp; a ≈øword of the which the imperfect ≈øhould haue feare. Hee burneth with liuely flames who ≈øerueth God with loue: and his throat is cut who ≈øerueth God with feare, and not vvith loue. Whereupon it is, that in the arke of <hi>Noe</hi> there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny little roomes, and in the hou≈øe of God many dwelling pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ≈øo al≈øo in the Catholicke church there are diuers maners of ≈øeruing of God, he doth ≈øerue God much better who ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him with loue, than he who followeth him for feare: but in fine ≈øo as we doe not offend our Lord, be it with loue, or be it with feare, let vs alwaies ≈øerue him. He is happy who ≈øuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his throat to be cut with the knife of feare, but he is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry happy who goeth to warme him≈øelfe at the fire of his loue: for the feare may be ≈øo great, that he may erre in that which he taketh in hand, but he who loueth him much cannot erre in that which he doth. According vnto <hi>Ouid,</hi> he cannot erre who loueth a good thing, nor there can bee no errour where there is perfect loue. <hi>Cyrillus</hi> ≈øayth, If the Synagogue did

What is all that vvorth vvhich I doe, or vvhat am I vvorth vvhich doe it, if I doe it not for God? Hee doth offer vp all his eares of his corne dried, who dooth all his vvorkes for God, and hee doth offer them greene, who doth them not but only for men, vvhom vvee do a≈ø≈øure, that for tho≈øe God will neuer pay, nor yet men be thankfull.

He offereth vnto our Lord greene eares, who hath no patience in trauels: for as the value of gold is knowne in the gold≈ømithes melting pot, ≈øo is a good Chri≈øtian known in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation.

Gods humane life dooth end, death to hell, ≈øinne to the world, idolatry to gentility, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies to the law, and figures to the Scripture. Pope <hi>Leo</hi> ≈øayth, by this word <hi>Con≈øummatum e≈øt,</hi> was ended, the reproch of the cro≈ø≈øe, the bani≈øhment from heauen, the power of the diuell, the trea≈øon of the di≈øciple, the denying of <hi>Peter,</hi> the ≈øentence of <hi>Pilate,</hi> the indignation of the people, the life of the ≈øonne, and the comfort of the mother. O comfortle≈ø≈øe mother, O virgine borne without the like, what griefe did thy ≈øorrowfull heart feele, when thou hearde≈øt thy ≈øonne ≈øay that his life was ended, thou continuing as thou did≈øt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thy ≈øonne?

This is another kind of banquet than that which the Emperour <hi>Vitellius</hi> made to certaine Emba≈ø≈øadors of Per≈øia, of which <hi>Plutarch</hi> ≈øayth,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:3666:220"/>That if they had bound them≈øelues to giue them another dinner like vnto their ≈øupper, hee doubteth whether all the trea≈øure of Rome would haue ≈øufficed to haue done it.

If there ≈øhould be no my≈øtery contained vnder the≈øe words, the text would ≈øeem to be contrary to it ≈øelfe, for if his body be full of bitternes, how could her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tain any more iuice of wormwood, and if he could receiue more, how then was hee full? For the
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:3666:221"/>vnder≈øtanding of this, you mu≈øt vnder≈øtand that as Chri≈øt was more than an Angell, ≈øo he had more innocency than an Angell; and as he was more than a Prophet, ≈øo he had more knowledge than a Prophet; &amp; as he was more than a prince, ≈øo hee had more power than a Prince; and as hee was more than a ≈øaint, ≈øo he had more perfection in him than ≈øaints; and al≈øo becau≈øe he was a greater Martyr than all other Martirs, he did ≈øuffer more martyrdome than any other Martyr. <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> vpon <hi>Iob</hi> ≈øayth, That by rea≈øon that the ≈øonne of God was more than man, becau≈øe he was both God and man, hee knew more than a man, he could doe more than a man, hee did more than a man, he ≈øuffered more than a man, and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more than any man; for the griefs which pa≈ø≈øed through his heart, and the torments which his members ≈øuffered, what tongue is able to rehear≈øe them, how much more what body is able to ≈øuffer them? Euery martyr may ≈øay with <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> He hath filled me with bitternes; becau≈øe they were tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with ≈øo many torments: but the ≈øonne of God onely can ≈øay, And he hath made me drunk with ab≈øynth: that is to wit, ouer &amp; be≈øides that he ≈øuffered all that other martirs did ≈øuffer, he did ≈øuffer another new kind of martyrdome, which did exceed all other martyrdomes of man. All the holy and cho≈øen men of our Lord haue drunk a thou≈øand draughts of very bitter martyrdome, but the ≈øon of God only did drinke Ab≈øynth, becau≈øe there was no heauine≈ø≈øe which did not po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øe his heart, nor no dolour which did not oppre≈ø≈øe his members. Saint <hi>Ambro≈øe</hi> ≈øayth, All the words which Chri≈øt ≈øpake we may beleeue, but all the excellent workes that hee did, we be not able to imitate; becau≈øe that be≈øides the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ≈øtrength which bodies are wont to haue, he tooke more to bee able to ≈øuffer tho≈øe torments, for the fle≈øh of the ≈øonne of God was ≈øo tender and delicate of it ≈øelfe, that if he ≈øhould not haue added force vnto his owne force, and ≈øtrength vnto his owne ≈øtrength, it could not haue been but he ≈øhould haue died very yong, or el≈øe neuer haue been able to haue ≈øuffered ≈øo high a martyrdome. What was Chri≈øts meaning then, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>
                  <pb n="438" facs="tcp:3666:222"/>he ≈øaid <hi>Inebriauit me ab≈øynthio,</hi> But that hee onely drunke that drinke of ab≈øynth, ≈øeeing that hee alone did ≈øuffer more torments than all the Martyrs. Chri≈øt is not contented to ≈øay, that hee drunke much of that drinke, but that hee drunke it all, to let vs thereby vnder≈øtand, that as no man can be drunk but with pure wine, ≈øo the ≈øonne of God was he who ≈øuffered pure martyrdome without any ea≈øe at all. No man euer drank of pure martyrdome as Chri≈øt did, for all other martyrs, if they ≈øuffered in ≈øome of their members, they did not in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and if they ≈øuffered in body, they ≈øuffered not in ≈øpirit, and if they ≈øuffered in ≈øpirit, they had ≈øome comfort in it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øomuch that the comfort which God gaue them was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the martyrdome which they ≈øuffered. Vpon tho≈øe words of the P≈øalme, <hi>Extraneus ≈øum fratribus meis, Ba≈øil</hi> ≈øaith, Chri≈øt was a ≈øtranger and ≈øeperated from his brothers, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther martyrs his companions, becau≈øe that in his bitter pa≈øsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hee was le≈ø≈øe comforted and more tormented than any of them. Like vnto a man ouerloaden with reproach and infamy, and full of torment, Chri≈øt ≈øaid vpon the cro≈ø≈øe, <hi>Deus, Deus, meus quare me dereliquisti?</hi> The which complaint he would neuer haue v≈øed, if his father had comforted him as hee did other Martyrs. Speaking the more particularly, Chri≈øt in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øting gaule and vineger, ≈øaid immediately <hi>Con≈øummatum e≈øt,</hi> to let vs thereby vnder≈øtand, that in that bitter drink was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the cure of the ≈øweet ta≈øt which <hi>Adam</hi> had in eating the apple. The figure doth very well an≈øwere vnto the thing figured, and the hurt vnto the remedy, in that, that as that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in by the mouth in which <hi>Adam</hi> ≈øinned, ≈øo by Chri≈øts mouth entered in the remedie of that ≈øin; &amp; as ≈øin began in a ≈øweet apple, ≈øo it ≈øhould end in ≈øoure vineger. Hard by the wood <hi>Adam</hi> committed the offence, &amp; on the wood Chri≈øt redeemed the ≈øinne; in ≈øweetne≈ø≈øe our hurt began, and in bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne≈ø≈øe began our good and remedy. <hi>Adam</hi> in eating of that which liked him died, and Chri≈øt ta≈øting of that which was bitter gaue vp his gho≈øt. Becau≈øe the truth ≈øhould an≈øwere vnto the figure, the ≈øpirit vnto the letter, and the ≈øecret vnto
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:3666:222"/>the my≈øtery, &amp; the fault to the pain, the ≈øon of Gods plea≈øure was, that his la≈øt torment ≈øhould bee with ≈øharpe vineger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe that with that drinke ≈øhould bee cured the grieuou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe of our ≈øinne. <hi>Ad anunciandum man≈øuet is mi≈øit me, vt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tritis corde, &amp; predicarem captiuis indulgentia &amp; clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øis aper≈øionem, E≈øay,</hi> 61. The≈øe are the wordes of the redeemer of the world ≈øpoken by the mouth of the Prophet <hi>E≈øayas,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring by them his meaning why he came from heauen into the world, ≈øaying, The cau≈øe why I came into the world, was to preach vnto the meeke, to cure the di≈øea≈øed, to tell cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues that they ≈øhould be deliuered, and denounce to all that are bound that they ≈øhall be now loo≈øed. The redeemer of the world reciteth foure cau≈øes why he came into the world; that is, to preach vnto the good, to cure the di≈øea≈øed, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem captiues, and loo≈øe pri≈øoners. The≈øe foure things are ≈øo high to be enterpri≈øed, and ≈øo hard to be atchieued, that none but Chri≈øt in the world was able to do it. It may be, that ≈øome man be able to preach, but he cannot cure, and if he can cure infirmities, yet he is not of power to redeem captiues, &amp; if he be of power to redeem captiues, yet hee hath no authority to let go pri≈øoners: in≈øomuch that there is no man in the world ≈øo valerous, but doth want the performance of one of the≈øe four things, only the ≈øon of God hath all, ≈øeeth all, vnder≈øtandeth all, knoweth all, and can do all. And therevpon it happeneth, that man doth not performe that which hee taketh in hand, becau≈øe he cannot, but Chri≈øt not becau≈øe he cannot, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he wil not. <hi>E≈øaias</hi> ≈øaith, That Chri≈øt came fir≈øt to preach to the humble &amp; meeke, &amp; not to the prowd, to let vs therby vnder≈øtand, that the meek &amp; gentle would beleeue him, and the prowd and fooli≈øh mocke at his life and doctrine. Hee ≈øayth ≈øecondly, that he came to cure and heale him who had his heart broken, and not tho≈øe who had no repentance of their naughtines, to let vs therby vnder≈øtand, that the ≈øhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his precious bloud ≈øhould haue no vertue nor efficacy in tho≈øe which neuer ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d, but in ≈øuch as of their wickednes do repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>t. Thirdly he ≈øaith, that Chri≈øt came into the world to redeem captiues out of captiuity: wherin thou ≈øai≈øt mo≈øt truly
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:3666:223"/>O my good Ie≈øus, becau≈øe there was no ≈øinne in the world which thou didde≈øt not pay for, nor no ≈øinner whome thou didde≈øt not redeeme. Fourthly, he ≈øaith, that Chri≈øt came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world to deliuer pri≈øoners out of gaole, and loo≈øe them out of pri≈øon: wherein he ≈øayth al≈øo mo≈øt truly, for he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer all men from the thraldome of the diuell, and redeeme ≈øinners who were captiues.

Vpon the≈øe words, <hi>Vt mederer corde contritis,</hi> S. <hi>Augustine</hi> ≈øayth, <hi>Magnus venit medicus, quia magnus vbique iacebat egrotus,</hi> as if hee ≈øhould ≈øay, agreeable to the words of <hi>E≈øayas,</hi> There came from high heauen a very great Phi≈øition, becau≈øe that in euery corner of the earth there lay a ≈øick body. What Phi≈øition was there euer in the world who brought ≈øuch medicines as Chri≈øt did, or kept ≈øuch an order in curing vs? the order which Phi≈øitians pre≈øcribe, is, that fir≈øt they ordain a diet for the patient, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate the humours, then they procure him ≈øome ≈øweat to expell vento≈øities, then they let him bloud to correct the matter, and then they giue him a purgation to rid and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty him of all that is ≈øuperfluous and hurtfull in him. The Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitian doth all this, giuing a receit in a paper, and ≈øending it to the Apothecary, and mini≈øtring it to the patient; in ≈øo much that the Phi≈øitions cure is in the pul≈øe which he doth handle, and receit which hee ordaineth.

Touching the ≈øecond, the humanity of the word wanteth weight, &amp; he cannot be weighed, for all the Saints being put in one balance, and the ≈øonne of God in another, it would bee that, that a drop of water is in re≈øpect of all the water which is in the world.

That which we ≈øay of the diuinity, we may al≈øo ≈øay of the humanity, ≈øeeing that it was in the beginning
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:3666:226"/>of God, by an Hypo≈øtaticall vnion in the word, and by an excellency of perfection aboue all that which God created. And the word was with God, ≈øaith al≈øo S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> as if he ≈øhould ≈øay, Becau≈øe thou maie≈øt ≈øee that the per≈øon of the Father is not the per≈øon of the ≈øonne, nor the per≈øon of the ≈øonne the per≈øon of the Father, if I haue ≈øaid, that In the beginning was the word, I ≈øay now that neere vnto God was the ≈øame word, in ≈øo much that that which is neere vnto mee is without all doubt di≈øtingui≈øhed from me. The humanity is ≈øo neere vnto the diuinity, that it is one per≈øon with it, and thereupon it is, that as in the Father and in the ≈øonne there is but one e≈ø≈øence although they be two per≈øons, ≈øo in the word of God, and in the humanity of Chri≈øt, although there bee two natures, there is but one per≈øon; and this diuine, and not humane.

S. <hi>Augu≈øtine</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ≈øayth, As all things in God ≈øhall be called life, becau≈øe they are accompanied and ioined in him, ≈øo in his holy humanity, all things are life, becau≈øe there are vnited in him all the goodne≈ø≈øe of glory and grace. As all that which is made in the word is life, &amp; al that which is out of it is death, ≈øo all that which is wrought in Chri≈øt for his honour and glory is life, and all that which is not done in him and by him is all death. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> goeth forward and ≈øayth, And the life was the light of men, which he ≈øpeaketh for the
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:3666:226"/>light of rea≈øon, which hee did imprint in the ≈øoules, which were blind by ≈øinne, the which blindne≈ø≈øe was remedied with the light of the humanity of Chri≈øt, the which although it do not ≈øhine like vnto the mo≈øt ≈øimple diuine light, yet it was ≈øufficient to lighten all humane nature: and hee addeth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, That the light doth ≈øhine in darkene≈ø≈øe, <hi>Et tenebrae eum non comprehenderunt,</hi> which words may be no le≈ø≈øe verified of the humanity of Chri≈øt than of the diuinity of the word. <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larius</hi> vpon tho≈øe words ≈øayth, In re≈øpect of the diuine clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe all other creatures may bee called darkene≈ø≈øe, becau≈øe it is impo≈øsible that the diuine ≈øhould not alwaies ≈øhine, but the humane hath euery houre need of light. God doth ≈øhine in the darkene≈ø≈øe of our ≈øinnes, ≈øeeing that none but hee can forgiue them: and in this point it is no other thing to ≈øay, <hi>Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae eum non comprehenderunt,</hi> but that his mo≈øt great mercy cannot be made empty. S. <hi>Barnard</hi> in a Sermon ≈øayth, God is mighty in forgiuing ≈øinnes, but he is mo≈øt mighty in forgiuing tho≈øe which are often committed, wherein is ≈øhewed his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mercy, ≈øeeing that he is not comprehended by them, nor limited in pardoning them, but hee doth pardon them when he will, how he will, and vnto whom he will. In that that hee is man, Chri≈øt hath al≈øo darkene≈ø≈øe where he may ≈øhine, that is to wit, all pure creatures be they neuer ≈øo holy and cho≈øen, ≈øeeing that of them≈øelues they haue no light at all, if they doe not receiue it of the ≈øonne of God. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ≈øayth, The perfection and light of Chri≈øt is ≈øo great, that being compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto that which other Saints haue, it ≈øeemeth that it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them ≈øomewhat vnperfect, which is to bee vnder≈øtood, not becau≈øe there is any want in them, but becau≈øe there is a great abundance of excellency. <hi>Irenaus</hi> in a Sermon ≈øayth, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God tooke from the ≈øpirit of <hi>Moy≈øes</hi> to giue vnto tho≈øe elders which ≈øhould be iudges with him, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding <hi>Moy≈øes</hi> continued wi≈øer than they: ≈øo it is in Chri≈øt, from whom how much grace ≈øo euer the holy men doe take, or haue taken, yet they did neuer draw his grace drie, nor at any time compared them≈øelues with him.

It is a thing much to be wondred at, and worthely to be noted, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the <hi>Sancta</hi> was not rich, and when the great citie of Ieru≈øalem was poore, with their pouerty they did ouercome all their enemies, and afterward with their wealth they were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by them. <hi>Dauid</hi> was poorer than <hi>Salomon,</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> was poorer than <hi>Dauid,</hi> and yet for all their pouerty they had more victories ouer their enemies then <hi>Salomon</hi> and <hi>Roboam</hi> his ≈øonne in their times, who≈øe riches &amp; trea≈øures did exceed the trea≈øures of their predece≈ø≈øors. Men thinke that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy again≈øt mi≈øery &amp; pouerty, doth con≈øi≈øt in getting much wealth and riches, and in hauing abundance of all things; the which thing to thinke is a great vanity, and a dangerous thing
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:3666:228"/>to get, for we ≈øee many, who thinking to bring wealth and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to their hou≈øe, bring death, war, and di≈ø≈øention to it: and becau≈øe we may not ≈øeeke far for examples, let vs looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Iewes with their trea≈øures, and if wee weigh the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter well, we ≈øhall find for a truth that mi≈øery &amp; pouerty is not remedied with riches, and that the captain of mi≈øery is peace, and the companion of riches is mi≈øery. No longer after the death of <hi>Salomon</hi> but fiue yeares, <hi>Se≈øach</hi> king of Aegypt did ≈øend to Ieru≈øalem ≈øeuenty thou≈øand hor≈øemen, and twi≈øe as many footmen, and a thou≈øand two hundred Wagons for ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and took Ieru≈øalem and robbed the Temple, and ≈øpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led king <hi>Roboams</hi> pallace: in≈øomuch that the Temple was not ≈øo long a ≈øacking as it was a building. The king of Babilon did ≈øend his army to Iudea, who v≈øed the matter ≈øo well, that hee tooke the city, and robbed the Temple, and led the king of Iudea pri≈øoner to Babilonia, and no man was able to re≈øi≈øt him or hurt him. After this great mi≈øchiefe came the king of the Chaldeans, who killed the yong men, tooke the women captiue, ≈øet fire on their towres, burnt the ≈øanctuary, &amp; tooke the people pri≈øoners, and robbed the trea≈øure. The warres which the Aegyptians, Chaldeans, and Babilonians had with the Hebrews, were not becau≈øe they did hold them for their enemies, but only to rob their trea≈øures: n≈øomuch that again≈øt the poore I≈øraelites made greater warres their owne riches, than all other barbarous nations. Let the litterall conclu≈øion be, that wee may ≈øay truly of the Temple of <hi>Salomon, Quod Con≈øummatum e≈øt,</hi> ≈øeeing that the Temple is at an end, <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> which made it, the people where it was made, the riches with the which it was made, and the ≈øacrifices for the which it was made. Of all this we may gather, that God dooth not giue vs riches, becau≈øe we ≈øhould loue them, but becau≈øe wee ≈øhould benefite our ≈øelues by them, &amp; ≈øerue him with them: but ala≈ø≈øe that which God doth giue vs to ≈øerue him withal, we doe turne to our owne plea≈øures and delights. <hi>Dominus in templo ≈øancto ≈øuo, dominus in caelo ≈øedes eius,</hi> ≈øayth the P≈øal. 10. as if he would ≈øay, The places where our Lord doth mo≈øt of
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:3666:229"/>all abide are in the heauens vvhere he hath his ≈øeat, and in the holy Temple where he hath his dwelling place. Becau≈øe we ≈øhould not thinke that the Temple vvhich he here ≈øpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of is the Temple of <hi>Salomon</hi> in Ieru≈øalem, or of <hi>Dian.</hi> in Antiochia, or of <hi>Pantheus</hi> in Rome. God ≈øaid not that hee dwelled in euery Temple, but he added holy, and al≈øo his For in the Temple where God mu≈øt dwell there mu≈øt be no ≈øinne, nor any el≈øe with him. The Temple which <hi>Salomon</hi> made vvas very rich, and although it vvas a Temple, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not that it vvas holy, for if it had been, and tho≈øe al≈øo which made it, they would not haue killed within it the great Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> hard by the altar, nor they would not haue placed the Idoll <hi>As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Neither was that Temple holy in re≈øpect of the Prie≈øts and mini≈øters which were in it, for if it had beene holy they would not haue had birds at the gate to ≈øell, nor bankes for V≈øurers, nor Chri≈øt would not haue rebuked them, nor they put Chri≈øt to death. Neither was that Temple holy in re≈øpect of the ≈øacrifices, ≈øeeing that they were not ≈øufficient to take away ≈øinnes: and if there was any profit in them, it was not by rea≈øon of the ≈øacrifice which was there offered, but in re≈øpect of the merits of tho≈øe which did offer them. Neither vvill vve ≈øay that <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple vvas holy by rea≈øon of the matter whereof it was made, becau≈øe that true and ≈øincere holine≈ø≈øe is not in gold, ≈øiluer, timber, &amp; ≈øtone, whereof it was made, but in the Chri≈øtian and glorious Temple which is there a≈ø≈øembled and gathered together. It followeth then of that which is ≈øpoken, that God doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide euery where, &amp; where euery man lu≈øteth, but where our Lord wil make his dwelling place mu≈øt be a Temple, and that a holy Temple, and his owne Temple, or els hee will dwell vvith none.

<pb n="453" facs="tcp:3666:229"/>Wee ≈øhall call his deified body a Temple, and a holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and his owne Temple: becau≈øe of him and of no other, God ≈øaid at the riuer of Iordan, This is my welbeloued ≈øon.

This our Temple is farre more richer than <hi>Salomons</hi> was, for if his was couered with gold, ≈øo ours is couered with diuine loue: and the difference betwixt tho≈øe two may ea≈øily bee knowne, by the difference that is betwixt a ≈øimple gilter, and a great louer. In <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple, the things of gold were ≈øo mea≈øured, &amp; tho≈øe of wood ≈øo leuelled, that when they were laid downe, there was no Ax nor hamber heard: When the Holy-gho≈øt did frame the Temple of the mo≈øt ≈øacred hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of Chri≈øt in the wombe of the ble≈ø≈øed Virgine <hi>Mary,</hi> hee framed it ≈øo iu≈øt, and made it in all perfection ≈øo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui≈øite, that there was there no axe of ≈øinne, nor hamber of the diuell. The windowes of that temple were broader with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in than vvithout, to ≈øignifie vnto vs that the loue which Chri≈øt had ≈øecretly in his entrails was farre greater and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than the wounds were which hee ≈øuffered for vs: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that at the beginning he doth lead his a ≈øtraight and narrow way, yet after that they doe ta≈øt of his heauenly loue he maketh all things broad and large vnto them.

S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ≈øayth likewi≈øe in this ≈øpeech of <hi>Ecce a≈øcendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> our great ≈øheepheard dooth admoni≈øh all other ≈øheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, that when nece≈øsity doth ≈øo require, they ≈øhould not oppo≈øe them≈øelues again≈øt any tyrant if they vvould put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> to death, but al≈øo offer them≈øelues to death for the ≈øaluation of their flocke: becau≈øe there is no higher degree of martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, than to die for the ≈øauing of his neighbour. <hi>Simon de Ga≈øsia</hi> ≈øayth, For the ≈øonne of God to ≈øay vnto his di≈øciples, Behold I goe to die, and not, They carry mee to kill me; was to let them vnder≈øtand, that to the Chri≈øtian religion, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øsion of the Go≈øpell vvee ≈øhould not bee drawne by force, but goe willingly, becau≈øe our Lord doth not ≈øo much regard the feet with the which wee ≈øeeke him, as hee doth behold out intentions with which we loue him. And Chri≈øt ≈øaith fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Et con≈øummabuntur omnia quae ≈øcripta ≈øunt de me,</hi> as if he would ≈øay, The cau≈øe vvhy I goe to Ieru≈øalem is becau≈øe all things vvhich are vvritten of mee by the Prophets may bee fulfilled and accompli≈øhed. <hi>Origen</hi> ≈øayth, All thinges vvhich vvere vvritten of Chri≈øt are brought vnto three things, and all tho≈øe to be fulfilled by him, to wit, that vvhich he ≈øhould doe, that vvhich he ≈øhould ≈øuffer, and the reward vvhich he ≈øhould haue, a≈øwell for that vvhich hee did in his life, as for that vvhich he ≈øuffered at his death. That which Chri≈øt did, vvas to plant the church: that vvhich he ≈øuffered, was a mo≈øt cruell death: &amp; the reward vvhich he receiued, vvas his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious re≈øurrection: in≈øomuch that in his holy life, in his dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full death and pa≈øsion, and glorious re≈øurrection, all the holy Scripture is contained. The≈øe two ≈øpeeches vvhich Chri≈øt ≈øpake doe very vvell agree, that is, that vvhich he ≈øayth here <hi>Con≈øummabuntur omnia,</hi> and the other vvhich he vttered vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the cro≈ø≈øe <hi>Con≈øummatum e≈øt.</hi> For in that, that he died and ro≈øe againe, all vvas fulfilled that was vvritten of him. But ≈øpeaking more particularly, Chri≈øt ≈øayth, that in entring into Ieru≈øalem, he ≈øhould be deliuered vnto the Gentils, and that he ≈øhould bee mocked vvith iniurious vvords, and ≈øpet vpon
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:3666:233"/>with gro≈ø≈øe ≈øpettle, and whipped with much di≈øcipline, and that he ≈øhould al≈øo bee crucified and put to death with great nailes. Who euer ≈øaw or heard the like vnto this, that they ≈øhould vnload ≈øuch a heape of iniuries, and ≈øuch a multitude of torments vpon ≈øo tender a body, and ≈øo iu≈øt a per≈øon? <hi>Dedit percutientibus ≈øe maxillam, &amp; ≈øaturabitur opprebrijs,</hi> ≈øaith <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> chap. 3. Speaking of Chri≈øts iniuries, as if hee ≈øhould ≈øay, The redeemer of the world will bee ≈øo patient in his trauails, and ≈øo obedient vnto his per≈øecutors, that hee him≈øelfe will offer his cheeke to be buffetted, and he will put him≈øelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, becau≈øe they ≈øhould fill him with iniuries. How well ≈øo euer <hi>Ieremy</hi> did prophe≈øie this, yet Chri≈øt did fulfill it better, ≈øeeing that he offered vnto his enemies not onely his cheeke that they might buffet it, but al≈øo all his holy body that they might kill it. What meaneth this O good Ie≈øus, what meaneth this, The Prophet <hi>Elias</hi> did ≈øhe from the citie of Ieru≈øalem, becau≈øe Queene <hi>Iezabel</hi> ≈øhould not cut off his head, and doe≈øt thou goe to Ieru≈øalem, where thou knowe≈øt that they wil depriue thee of thy life? Great king <hi>Dauid</hi> fled from the city of Ieru≈øalem, and went out of it, becau≈øe hee would bee no more per≈øecuted of king <hi>Saul,</hi> and doe≈øt thou goe to Ieru≈øalem to bee crucified? In this point ≈øure thou art not <hi>Dauids</hi> ≈øonne, nor <hi>Helias</hi> companion, for if they flie from Ieru≈øalem to ≈øaue their liues, thou goe≈øt to Ieru≈øalem to offer thy ≈øelfe to death. If thy death had been a common death, it might haue been born with, but ≈øeeing that it was more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous to ≈øuffer the circum≈øtances of thy death, than death it ≈øelfe, what nece≈øsity con≈øtrained thee, or what charity moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thee why thou ≈øhoulde≈øt not haue fled with thy Father <hi>Dauid,</hi> or ab≈øented thee with the Prophet <hi>Ely?</hi> It is a thing worthy to bee noted, that Chri≈øt putteth it for the greate≈øt point of his Martyrdome that he ≈øhould be iniuried, and al≈øo that he ≈øhould be ≈øcorned and mocked. By which complaint hee doth let vs vnder≈øtand, that the ≈øonne of God did grieue more at the iniurious words which they ≈øpake vnto him, than at the la≈øhes and di≈øcipline which they gaue him. <hi>Ieremy</hi> doth
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:3666:234"/>not ≈øay that Chri≈øt ≈øhould be filled in his pa≈øsion with ≈øtripes <hi>flagellis,</hi> but <hi>opprobrijs,</hi> reuilings and iniuries, and the rea≈øon is, becau≈øe ≈øtripes &amp; la≈øhes pa≈ø≈øe no further than the ≈øhoulders, but iniuries entred vnto the entrails. Who is he in the world which wil not be more grieued at an iniurious word, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> with the point of a ≈øpeare? <hi>Ieremy</hi> maketh no reckoning of the thornes, nor of the nailes, nor of the la≈øhes, but onely of the iniuries which Chri≈øt ≈øuffered, ≈øeeing that hee ≈øaith, <hi>Saturabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur opprobrijs,</hi> becau≈øe hee pa≈ø≈øed through tho≈øe torments but one day, but hee ≈øuffered iniuries and bla≈øphemies euery day. In the≈øe words of <hi>Ieremies,</hi> He ≈øhall be filled with iniuries: he ≈øignified vnto vs, the cruelty of his torments and the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his iniuries: for as hee who is full, hath no more place in his ≈øtomacke to fill, ≈øo there was no torment which to the ≈øonne of God they left vngiuen, nor no iniury vn≈øpoken. For what torments were there which they gaue him not, or what iniuries could there be ≈øpoken which they vttered not. <hi>Hugo de ≈øancto victore</hi> vpon <hi>Ieremy</hi> ≈øayth, Becau≈øe the ≈øon of God would declare that hee was the iu≈øte≈øt of all others, and of all martyrs the greate≈øt martyr, he ≈øaid that he ≈øhould be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with iniuries and reuilings: becau≈øe that in all other mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, they did lay hands with no other intention, but to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr them, but in Chri≈øt they laid hands to kill him, &amp; tongues to iniury him. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> on this place ≈øayth, <hi>Ieremy</hi> ≈øaith very well of Chri≈øt, <hi>Quod ≈øaturabitur opprobrijs:</hi> for wee doe not read of any Martyr, that he was martyred with tongues, but with hands, the ≈øon of God alone is he, who≈øe life they tooke away with their hands, and fame with their tongues. <hi>I≈øichius</hi> vpon Leuiticus ≈øayth, With great rea≈øon, the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> ≈øayth of Chri≈øt, That he ≈øhould be filled with iniuries: ≈øeeing wee ≈øee, that in his holy pa≈øsion, liers doe ≈øell the truth, ≈øooles mocke wi≈øedome, the guilty whip innocency, the wretched ≈øpet vpon glory, and the dead kill life. S. <hi>Barnard</hi> in a ≈øermon of the pa≈øsion ≈øayth, What heart is able to endure it, or what fingers able to write it, to ≈øee that the liberty of captiues is ≈øold, the glory of Angels ≈øcorned and mocked, the morning

S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bro≈øe</hi> vpon S. <hi>Luke</hi> ≈øayth, Of Chri≈øt only, &amp; of no other <hi>Ieremy</hi> ≈øayth, <hi>Quod ≈øaturabitur opprobrijs:</hi> ≈øeeing that he was ≈øold like a malefactor, mocked like a foole, ≈øpet at like a vile per≈øon, whipped like a theefe, and put to death like a traitor.

Let our conclu≈øion then be, that not without a high my≈øtery, nor profound ≈øacrament, Chri≈øt before hee ≈øhould ≈øuffer, ≈øaid the≈øe words of <hi>Con≈øummabuntur,</hi> and in the end of his ≈øuffering, <hi>Con≈øummatum e≈øt,</hi> to let vs vnder≈øta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d, that at one time Chri≈øts life did end: and if we be ≈øuch as we ought to be our faults.</p>

How≈øoeuer Chri≈øt our redeemer praied from the hart for tho≈øe which he loued from the heart, yet he ≈øet this word

                  <hi>Sancte Pater</hi> before his praier, becau≈øe it is a very naturall thing, that this word <hi>Pater,</hi> maketh a father attentiue to here the child, and maketh his eies tender to behold him, and his heart gentle to loue him, and openeth his entrails that hee can deny him nothing.

That which I aske for them is, that as they are his by faith, they may be his al≈øo by charity, for it would little auaile them to bee con≈øtant in faith if they ≈øhould not be al≈øo feruent in loue. <hi>Remigius</hi> ≈øayth, There is no doubt but the ≈øonne of God was neuer asked by any, nor importuned by any, nor ≈øuborned by any to pray for tho≈øe of his colledge, but of him≈øelfe, hee moued him≈øelfe to pray, and commend them to his Father, giuing vs thereby to vnder≈øtand, what great care he hath to looke vnto vs, if wee be not carele≈ø≈øe to ≈øerue him.

To ≈øay that Chri≈øt ≈øhould not entreat for the world, it is a dreadfull ≈øpeech, and yet to pray that he ≈øhould not ≈øpoile the world of the good, is a ≈øpeech of great comfort: for ≈øeeing that hee would not haue the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good ones, it is a ≈øigne that hee would that by them wee ≈øhould be conuerted. When the Lord would drowne all the world with a floud, he did fir≈øt put <hi>Noe</hi> in ≈øafety; and when he would ≈øend fire vpon Sodome and Gomorra, hee placed <hi>Lot</hi> vpon a high hill; and when hee would puni≈øh the murmurers in the de≈øert, hee commanded <hi>Moy≈øes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to goe out to the field: ≈øo that it is a great ≈øigne that God is angry with ≈øome when hee taketh the good out of their company.

It is al≈øo much to bee noted, that our Lord dooth not entreat his Father, that hee would not take the good out of the world, but that hee would keepe them from all perill and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: in ≈øo much that in his mo≈øt high praier hee dooth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forget the vveake, nor bee carele≈ø≈øe of the good, becau≈øe for ≈øinners hee praieth that they bee not for≈øaken of the good, and for the iu≈øt hee praieth, that they bee not ouermai≈øtered by ≈øinners.

There bee many which beleeue that there is a God as the Pagan dooth, and beleeue God as the diuel doth, but they do not beleeue in God as the good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian doth: for the Apo≈øtle ≈øayth, that our faith is not knowne by the words which we ≈øpeake, but in the good works which

God ≈øpake the≈øe words to holy <hi>Moy≈øes,</hi> giuing him order how the Prie≈øts ≈øhould be appointed, and how the ≈øacrifices ≈øhould be offered, as if he would ≈øay, If any Hebrew will offer vnto God any fruit to bee fried in a frying pan, the floure mu≈øt bee kned with oile, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leauen, and after it is well fried, and oile ≈øprinkled vpon it, and cut into very ≈ømal peeces, ≈øo offered vnto <hi>Aaron,</hi> to bee offered vpon the altar. Before wee come to expound the≈øe my≈øteries, we mu≈øt ≈øhew the cau≈øe why our Lord would bu≈øie and occupy the people of the Iewes, in ≈øuch ≈øtrange rites, in ≈øuch new ≈øacrifices, and in ≈øo many ceremonies, being as hee was, ≈øo graue a Lord, and ≈øo mighty a God. <hi>Stapulen≈øis</hi> in the fir≈øt of <hi>Leuiticus</hi> ≈øayth, That for three cau≈øes God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Iewes, to offer ≈øo many ≈ømall ≈øacrifices, and made with ≈øo many ceremonies. The fir≈øt is, that becau≈øe the Iews had beene brought vp in Aegypt, where all were idolatours, and they giuen to Idolatry, the Lord would that they ≈øhould offer tho≈øe ≈øacrifices vnto him, and not to the gods of the Gentiles. The ≈øecond rea≈øon is, that becau≈øe vnder tho≈øe ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:3666:240"/>hee would declare and figure the true ≈øacrifice which ≈øhould come into the world which was his precious ≈øonne. The third rea≈øon is, that being occupied in that multitude of ≈øacrifices they ≈øhould haue no time to be≈øtow in committing of other ≈øinnes, becau≈øe the foundation of all wickedne≈ø≈øe is accur≈øed idlene≈ø≈øe. It is al≈øo to be noted, that there was ≈øeuen kinds of ≈øacrifices in the old law, vnto the which all other were reduced, although they ≈øeemed to be infinite. The fir≈øt ≈øacrifice was called <hi>Holocau≈øtum,</hi> which was the greate≈øt and mo≈øt ≈øumptuou≈øt of all, becau≈øe it was offered vnto our Lord without any other re≈øpect: the ≈øecond was called <hi>Pacificum</hi> becau≈øe it was offered in time of warre, partly becau≈øe our Lord ≈øhould giue them peace in their times, and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he ≈øhould giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> victory again≈øt their enemies. The third was called <hi>Propiciatory</hi> which was offered in time of great dearth or pe≈øtilence, and the end of it was becau≈øe our Lord ≈øhould withdraw his hand from ouer them, and take that plague from them. The fourth was called <hi>Pontificat,</hi> which was offered for the ≈øinnes of the prie≈øt of the Temple, and the end of it was, becau≈øe they did hold it certaine, that if the Prie≈øt were loaden with ≈øinnes, that the Lord at his handes would not accept the ≈øacrifices. The fift was called <hi>Regale,</hi> which was offered for the ≈øinnes which the king had committed, and the end of it was, becau≈øe the Lord ≈øhould pardon the ≈øins which he had committed, &amp; lighten him to gouern well his Commonwealth. The ≈øixt was called Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which was offered for the ≈øins of all the people of I≈ørael, &amp; the end of it was, that the Lord ≈øhould take them vnder his protection, &amp; look vpon that people. The ≈øeuenth was called Particular, &amp; this was offered for euery particular per≈øon, and the end of it was, that God ≈øhould pardon him for that which was pa≈øt, &amp; giue him grace to amend hereafter. All the≈øe ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices differed in the bea≈øts which were offered in them, &amp; in the ceremonies with the which they were offered: and in one thing they all agreed, that is, that there could no ≈øacrifice be made for the remi≈øsion of any ≈øin, vnle≈ø≈øe the bloud of one
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:3666:240"/>cleane bea≈øt were ≈øhed. The Apo≈øtle ≈øaid not without great cau≈øe, <hi>Non fit ≈øanguinis effu≈øio ≈øed remi≈øsio,</hi> becau≈øe no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> could bee made cleane of a fault in the old law but by the death of ≈øome bea≈øt. <hi>Origen</hi> ≈øayth, It is certain that euery bea≈øt doth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liue by his bloud, than by his fle≈øh, or members, or bones which he goeth with, for when he leaueth bleeding, hee lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth breathing. Although it bee true, that in recompence of the lea≈øt fault, we are bound to offer our life for it, yet God in the old law was content with the life of a dead bea≈øt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of the life which that Iew did owe him. O how happie we be which fight vnder the name of Chri≈øt, becau≈øe the pari≈øhioners of the ≈øynagogue did offer the bloud of dead bea≈øts, but the faithful Chri≈øtians offer nothing but the bloud of the ≈øonne of the liuing God; in≈øomuch that we haue no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øsity to offer our liues in recompence of our offences, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the life of one was ≈øufficient to make cleane all the faults of the world. S. <hi>Paule</hi> could not prai≈øe Chri≈øts buying of vs better, than to ≈øay, <hi>Emptiestis pretio magno,</hi> giuing vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to vnder≈øtand, that with the bloud of his vaines hee had bought our liues, and al≈øo taken away our offences. For to haue pardoned a Iew of his fault, it was nece≈ø≈øary euery time that hee had ≈øinned, to kill a bea≈øt: but in Chri≈øts holy law one death tooke away all deaths, one life did buy all liues, and one paine tooke away all paines and offences. When the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtle calleth Chri≈øt, <hi>Hostiam viuentem,</hi> he wanteth not a deepe ≈øecret and a profound my≈øtery, becau≈øe that in the old law they called <hi>Hostia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>,</hi> the ≈øacrifice which was offered again≈øt tho≈øe which were enemies, &amp; they offered nothing but dead ≈øacrifices, becau≈øe the bea≈øt which they did offer was neither called ≈øacrifice, nor <hi>Hostia,</hi> vntill his life had been taken from him. The ≈øonne of God gaue the name of <hi>Ho≈øtia</hi> a ≈øacrifice when he died, and the name of life when he ro≈øe againe, and therefore wee may very well call him a liuely ≈øacrifice, a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øacrifice, a pure ≈øacrifice, and holy bread, ≈øeeing that hee is the ≈øacrifice and <hi>Hostie</hi> which giueth life vnto all,
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:3666:241"/>and is the holie≈øt ≈øacrifice of all other, and the pure≈øt, and the cleane≈øt bread of all others. <hi>Anima cum obtulerit oblationem ≈øacrificij domino ≈øimilae erit eius oblatio &amp; fundet ≈øuper eam ole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, &amp; ponet thus, Leuit.</hi> 2. God ≈øpake the≈øe words vnto <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes,</hi> becau≈øe he ≈øhould tel them the people of I≈ørael, as if hee ≈øhould ≈øay, If any will offer any ≈øacrifice which ≈øhall bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable vnto mee, offer mee it of the pure≈øt floure mingled with oile, and therewithall he ≈øhal adde a little frankincen≈øe. If wee doe curiou≈øly looke vnto it, of three things onely our Lord requireth an offering of vs, that is pure floure, good oile, and ≈øweet incen≈øe; the which things are ea≈øiy to bee found, light to offer, and not co≈øtly to buy. S. <hi>Ambro≈øe</hi> ≈øayth, In this wee may ≈øee what a great de≈øire our Lord hath to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the ≈øinnes which we commit again≈øt him, in that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe doth teach vs what ≈øacrifices we ≈øhould offer vnto him. What is vnder≈øtood by that fine ≈øifted floure, but that mo≈øt ≈øacred humanity of the ≈øonne of God? This holy floure was ≈øo ≈øifted and putrified, that all the Angels which ≈øhall come to ≈øee it, and all the men in the world which ≈øhall come to clen≈øe it, ≈øhall not find in that ≈øacred humanity one ≈ømal grite of originall ≈øinne, nor on ≈øpot of mortall ≈øinne, nor one little du≈øt of any other ≈ømall ≈øinne. Of this mo≈øt pure floure Chri≈øt did knead the ≈øacramentall bread in his la≈øt ≈øupper, which he left vs in the church, which doth differ farre from that which mother <hi>Eue</hi> did leaue her children, becau≈øe that in eating of that we doe ≈øinne, and receiuing of this we doe liue. What is the incen≈øe which God commaunded vs to offer with the floure in his Temple, but the diuinity which is ioined with the humanity in Chri≈øt? Vntill the gate of the Temple the floure was carried by it ≈øelfe, and the incen≈øe by it≈øelfe, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to the gate of the Temple, the one was incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with the other: which my≈øtery was mo≈øt notably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compli≈øhed in the comming of Chri≈øt, becau≈øe that ≈øo farre a≈øunder was mankind which was here vpon earth, from the diuinity which was in heauen, but the ≈øon of God comming into the world, immediately God with man, and man with
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:3666:241"/>God became one. What is the oile with the which God commanded the floure and incen≈øe to be tempered, but that which in the ble≈ø≈øed Trinitie wee call the holy-gho≈øt? The coniunction &amp; bond of loue betwixt the Father and the ≈øon, and hee who did incorporate the floure with the incen≈øe, was no other but the holy-gho≈øt, for ≈øo ≈øaid the prophe≈øie, <hi>Vnxit te deus, deus tuus eleo letetia,</hi> and ≈øo ≈øaid the Angell vnto the virgine when he ≈øaid, <hi>Spiritus ≈øanctus ≈øuperueniet in te.</hi> That which the Prophet called oile, the Angell afterward did cal the holy-gho≈øt: in≈øomuch that the cake which God deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of floure, oile, and incen≈øe, was nothing el≈øe but the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of him which was made by the father, and by the ≈øon, and by the holy-gho≈øt. A cake ≈øo well ≈øea≈øoned, a ≈øacrifice ≈øo highly well made, which of the ≈øaints would not offer, and which of the Angels would not adore? The ≈øacrifice which God did demand in times pa≈øt, was not that which the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue did offer, but that which the catholike church doth now offer, for they did offer him dow wet in vineger, and fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtie oile, and mo≈øt ≈øharpe incen≈øe, but the ≈øacrifice which wee doe now offer him is the humanity and diuinity of Chri≈øt, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited and put together by the handes of the holy-gho≈øt. It is no rea≈øon that the Chri≈øtian and deuour reader ≈øhould be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant why God commanded but a part of the floure to bee offered, but all the incen≈øe. To put a mea≈øure in the floure was to ≈øay, that the humanity of it ≈øelfe was limitted and had an end, and to put no mea≈øure in the frankincen≈øe was to ≈øay, that in the diuinity there is neither beginning nor end, which is mo≈øt true, becau≈øe the workes which the ≈øonne of God did were limmitted and circum≈øcribed in that, that he was man, but being kneaded with the oile of the holy-gho≈øt, he made them infinite in value and weight. To come then to our fir≈øt purpo≈øe, the text ≈øayth, <hi>si oblatio tua fuerit de ≈øartagine ≈øimile con≈øper≈øa oleo, &amp; ab≈øque fermento, diuides eam minutatim, &amp; fundas ≈øuper cam oleum,</hi> as if he ≈øhould ≈øay, The fritter which thou ≈øhalt offer vnto me, ≈øhall bee made of the floure of the meale, without leauen, kned with very good oile, and then
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:3666:242"/>being well pricked, thou ≈øhalt ≈øprinckle it ouer with new oile. If there ≈øhould bee no my≈øtery hidden vnder this Iudaicall ≈øacrifice, wee might haue occa≈øion to thinke that our Lord were a glutton, and giuen to variety of meats, ≈øeeing that in the beginning of this chapter he asked of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> fritters or cake dre≈ø≈øed with good oile, and now againe a cake made of the floure of wheat, and that without leauen, ≈ømall broken, and fried in a frying pan in very whote oile. Of this high and new ≈øacrifice, what is the floure but the humanity which ≈øuffered, what the oile but the loue with the vvhich hee died, and what the frying pan but the cro≈ø≈øe where hee died? To ≈øay that God the Father did aske for a cake made in a frying pan, and to ≈øay that the cro≈ø≈øe of his ≈øonne was the frying pan, and that the fine floure of his precious fle≈øh was fried in that fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingpan, and that the oile with the which it was fried was the loue with the which he redeemed vs, is no vnreuerent ≈øpeech to v≈øe; neither is there any errorin affirming it, ≈øeeing wee he certain that there is no word writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> in holy Scripture which is not full of high my≈øtery. The property of the fryingpan is, being put vpon the fire the fire dooth not wa≈øt him nor melt him as hee doth many other thinges, and be≈øide: hee maketh tho≈øe meats which are cold, hard, and not to be eaten; whote, ≈øoft, and very ≈øauourous. What was the death and pa≈øsion of our redeemer Ie≈øus Chri≈øt, but a frying pan put to the fire? The ≈øacred humanity of Chri≈øt being put in the fryingpan of the cro≈ø≈øe, notwith≈øtanding all the torments which they gaue him, and all the iniuries and reproches which they ≈øpake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt him they neuer dimini≈øhed any part of his vertue, for although for the ≈øpace of three daies his ≈øoule was ≈øeperated from his body, yet they deuide not his Diety from his ≈øoule, nor from his body. <hi>I≈øichius</hi> vpon <hi>Leuiticus</hi> ≈øayth, Before that the ≈øonne of God was fried in the frying pan of the cro≈ø≈øe, his fle≈øh was ≈øo raw that it could not bee eaten, but after that the fire of his pa≈øsion did ≈øea≈øon it vs and frie it, there is nothing in heauen more ≈øauerous, nor nothing on the earth more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. <hi>Cyrillus</hi> in another ≈øence ≈øaith, There were four things
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:3666:242"/>in this ≈øacrifice, fire, the pan, oile, and flour: The≈øe four things were found in the pa≈øsion of Chri≈øt, that is, the fire which the Iewes kindled to the end hee ≈øhould dieithe frying pan, vvas the cro≈ø≈øe which they ≈øought out where hee ≈øhould die: and the oile, the loue and charity with the vvhich hee died there for to redeeme the world: and the floure, his mo≈øt ≈øacred fle≈øh vvhich there was fried. O glorious ≈øacrifice, O eternall meat, that thou art O ≈øonne of the liuing God, ≈øeeing that fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and whote, and ≈øea≈øoned, thou didde≈øt giue thy ≈øelfe in the frieng pan of the cro≈ø≈øe, to the end that all men might eat thee, and none excu≈øed from ≈øeruing thee. When the ≈øonne of God ≈øaid, <hi>Ni≈øi manducaueritis carnem filij hominis,</hi> his Di≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples being ≈øcandalized, <hi>Abierunt retror≈øum &amp; dixerunt, durus est hic ≈øermo.</hi> But after that, that mo≈øt ≈øacred fle≈øh was ≈øea≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; fried in the frying pan of the cro≈ø≈øe, it was ≈øoft &amp; ≈øweer to ta≈øt of, ≈øauerous to eat, and profitable to be taken. <hi>Sume tibi ≈øartaginem ferream, &amp; ponas eam murum ferreum, inter te &amp; eiuitatem,</hi> ≈øaid God by the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> chap. 4, as if hee ≈øhould ≈øay, Goe thy way out of the city, and thou ≈øhalt put a frieng pan of iron betweene thee and the city, becau≈øe thou maie≈øt neither ≈øee her, nor ≈øhee hurt thee. Who euer ≈øaw or heard the like, that the Lord ≈øhould command the Prophet to fight with a frying pan, and defend him≈øelfe behind the ≈øame? Tell me O <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> what hurt coulde≈øt thou do with a frying pan, ≈øeeing it hath no point, or how coulde≈øt thou defend thy ≈øelfe vnder it, con≈øidering that it will ≈øcar≈øe couer thy head? If thou wilt goe to fight take a launce with thee, and if thou wilt go to defend thy ≈øelfe from thy enemies take thy Target, becau≈øe the frying pan is fitter for the kitche<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the warre, and better to dre≈ø≈øe meat with than to fight. O glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious cro≈ø≈øe, O holy frying pan, where the fle≈øh of my God was fried, where his bloud was ≈øhed, where his charitie vvas enflamed, where our fault was melted, and where his life was ended. The frying pan of the Synagogue was neither good for warres nor profitable for peace: But thou holy cro≈ø≈øe and happy frying pan wa≈øt hee, with the which the diuell was
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:3666:243"/>ouercome, God pacified, the world redeemed, and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen opened. What thing can I put betwixt thee and mee O good Ie≈øus, but this precious cro≈ø≈øe &amp; frying pan where thou didde≈øt end thy life, that my ≈øin might not come vnto thee, nor thy puni≈øhment pa≈ø≈øe to me. Doe thou not think my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, doe thou not think, that God commanded the Prophet to put betweene him and the city a frying pan, for any good that it would doe him, but for that which the frying pan ≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified: for thereby was ≈øignified the cro≈ø≈øe and the crucified, which ≈øhould be a mediator betweene God and the world. O ≈øweet Ie≈øus, O my ≈øoules delight, where but in the frying pan of thy dolors and griefes, and where but in the oile of thy charity and loue, didde≈øt thou end con≈øume and fry my enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious ≈øinnes?

<pb n="481" facs="tcp:3666:243"/>yet there is greate≈øt attention to bee giuen when it ≈øpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the altar, or of a Prie≈øt, becau≈øe that, that my≈øtery cannot be handeled, and not talk of the my≈øteries of Chri≈øt. If we doe looke into the words of the text, we ≈øhall find that that which is annointed is the altar, that with the which it is ointed is holy oile, and the manner how is with one finger on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that ≈øeuen times; and that which was further ointed were all the ornaments of the altar. The≈øe were the qualities of the altar, neere vnto it were the holy breads, before it bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned lampes, on the ≈øide of it they did put the candle≈øtickes, on the top of it the offered ≈øacrifices, at the foot of it they ≈øhed the bloud, behind it were the people, ouer again≈øt it was the vaile, vpon it was the Cherubin, about it were the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines. This altar was made of wood which would not rot, there could come none to it but the Prie≈øts, they could not goe vp to it by ≈øteps nor ≈øtaires, night and day lampes burned there, &amp; other fire which ≈øhould not be put out. Although the altar of the Synagogue had many priuiledges, and great free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, yet it had a counterpei≈øe with it, which was, that vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> it they ≈ølew all the bea≈øts which they did offer vnto God, &amp; therefore it was ≈øometimes ≈øo bloudy &amp; ≈øo loaden with flies, that it ≈øeemed rather a bord in the butchery to cut fle≈øh on, then an altar of the church. Who is the true altar, &amp; the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly altar, and the cleane altar, but only the ≈øonne of the liuing God? <hi>Origen</hi> ≈øayth, In the Temple of the Synagogue the altar was one thing, and the Prie≈øt another, &amp; another thing that which they offered; but in the altar of the church, the altar where they offer, and the Prie≈øt which doth offer, and the ≈øacrifice which is offered, and he vnto whom it is offered is one and the ≈øame thing. <hi>Leo</hi> in a Sermon of our Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ≈øayth, In this high ≈øupper and in this holy altar, the ≈øonne of God is the ultar, and the meat, and he who inuiteth, and he who is inuited, he who eateth, and is eaten, hee who annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, and is annointed, he who offereth and is offered. What preheminences had the altar of the old Synagogue, which are not greater in the Catholicke church? Their altar was of
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:3666:244"/>the wood of the Mount Lybanus, &amp; ours of the mo≈øt ≈øacred humanity of Chri≈øt; theirs was of wood which would not corrupt, and ours of fle≈øh which cannot ≈øinne; theirs was made bloody with other bloud than their owne, and ours is wa≈øhed with his own bloud; vpon theirs they did kil bea≈øts, vpon ours they forgiue vs our offences; to theirs there could none go vp but the Prie≈øts of the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ple, but vnto ours al the ≈øinners of the world may come vnto; in theirs there burned a fire of light which mu≈øt euery houre be kindled and put together, but in ours there burneth the fire of his loue and charity which can neuer be extingui≈øhed. O holy altar, O glorious altar of the cro≈ø≈øe, in which there is offered not dead bea≈øts, but mens ≈øins, not to proue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> but to pardon them, where our weake ≈øerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are offered, not becau≈øe thou woulde≈øt prai≈øe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> O Lord, but becau≈øe thou woulde≈øt accept them, and where al≈øo the merits of thy holy ≈øonne are offered, not for his own ≈øake who was without ≈øin, but for ours who can doe nothing but ≈øinne. The altar of the Synagogue had no ≈øtep nor ≈øtaire, becau≈øe the common ≈øort did beleeue nothing in God but his e≈ø≈øence, but to the altar of our catholick church, which is a congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the faithful, they go vp by three ≈øteps, becau≈øe we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in one e≈ø≈øence &amp; three per≈øons. The text al≈øo ≈øaith, that the altar of the ≈øynagogue was annointed with one finger on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: who ≈øhal we ≈øay that this finger is but the ≈øelfe≈øame holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gho≈øt? <hi>Hilarius de Trinitate</hi> ≈øaith, In al the Trinity there is but one arm, &amp; that is the Father, of whom the Prophet ≈øaith, <hi>Et brachiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> meu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>fortauit eum,</hi> neither is there any more but one hand which is the ≈øon, of whom al≈øo the Prophet ≈øaith, <hi>Filius meuses tuego hodie genui te,</hi> nor there is in all the Trinity but one finger of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the ≈øcripture ≈øaith, <hi>Digitus dei hic e≈øt.</hi> In the vnctions &amp; creations of vs there are many fingers occupied, that is, my great grandfather begat my grandfather, and my grandfather my father, &amp; my father begat me, &amp; I begat my ≈øon, and my ≈øonne begat my nephew: but in the generation of Chri≈øt there was applied one only finger, which was the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of the holy-gho≈øt. <hi>Augu≈øt</hi> in a ≈øermon ≈øayth, Seeing that
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:3666:244"/>he which doth beget is one, and hee who is begotten is one, and ≈øhe who doth bring forth is one, and he for whom hee is borne is one, which is the world; why ≈øhould there haue been more then one finger, which was the Holy-gho≈øt? The text ≈øayth further, that the altar was not annointed once only, but ≈øeuen times a row. What is meant that Chri≈øt was annointed ≈øeuen times a row, but only that all the ≈øeuen gifts of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-gho≈øt were be≈øtowed vpon him? It is to bee noted, that in all the ≈øacrifices which they made of kine, ≈øheepe, and goats, and pigeons, the altar was alwaies annointed with bloud, ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing when they ordained <hi>Aaron</hi> a prie≈øt, at what time they did annoint it with oile alone, the which was not done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a my≈øtery. The rea≈øon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> is this, that becau≈øe al their ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were done to take away the Iews ≈øins, the which were to bee taken away with ≈øhedding of bloud, <hi>Quia ≈øine ≈øanguinis effu≈øione non fit remi≈øsio,</hi> ≈øayth the Apo≈øtle, there was no need of effu≈øion of bloud in the ≈øacrifice which did only repre≈øent Chri≈øt, becau≈øe in him there was no ≈øinne at all. Why ≈øhould they haue annointed with bloud the altar of the humanity of Chri≈øt, con≈øidering that not onely there was no ≈øin in him, but in him all the ≈øins of the world were to be taken away? If the curious Reader would deeply vnder≈øtand this high figure let him turn <hi>Moy≈øes</hi> name into the Father, and <hi>Aarons</hi> name into Chri≈øt, and the altar into humanity, and the name of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing into gift, and bloud into the water of bapti≈øm, &amp; the finger into the holy-gho≈øt, and then hee ≈øhall truly find, how well the truth doth an≈øwere vnto the figure, and the letter to the ≈øpirit. The text ≈øayth further in the ≈øame chapter. <hi>Vnxit altare cum omni≈øuppellectili,</hi> as if hee ≈øhould ≈øay, After that <hi>Moy≈øes</hi> had made an end of annointing the altar with holy oile, hee did al≈øo annoint all things that did belong to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, that is, ewars, ba≈øins, candle≈øtickes, towels, hookes, chafin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di≈øhes. Let no man thinke it to bee a ie≈øt, that God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to annoint with holy oile, not only the altar, but al≈øo all things which did appettaine to the altar, becau≈øe that by this is di≈øcouered one of the greate≈øt priuiledges that Chri≈øt had,
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:3666:245"/>which no man did euer but hee enioy in the world. What ≈øhould it meane that at the altar of the Synagogue there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained nothing which was not annointed with oile, but that there was nothing in the humanity of the word which was not fully repleni≈øhed with the holy-gho≈øt? Why is Chri≈øt called <hi>Sanctus ≈øanctoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>,</hi> but becau≈øe his holy vnction was more holy tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> that of all the other ≈øaints? When the church doth wa≈øh her creatures in bapti≈øm, ≈øhee doth with water wa≈øh, and as it were only there annoint ≈øoules which were defiled with ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ≈øin, the which ≈øoules are made ≈øo clean &amp; pure with that vnction, that if they ≈øhould depart pre≈øently out of this life, they ≈øhould imediately by Gods fauor go to glory. O vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py that we be, for although they wa≈øh &amp; annoint our ≈øoule in bapti≈øm, yet there remaineth our memory to be annointed, ≈øee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that wee forget God; there remaineth our vnder≈øtanding to be annointed, ≈øeeing we think of other things tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> of God; there remaineth our will to be annointed, ≈øeeing that wee put our loue on other things be≈øides God; &amp; al≈øo our hart remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to be annointed, ≈øeeing we giue it to another tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> to god. What ≈øhall we ≈øay of our poore body, ≈øeeing there is no part or me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>ber of it which is annointed? ≈øeeing my eies can ≈øee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but vanity, my ears hear nothing but lightnes, my toung nothing but lie, my me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>bers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>mit ≈øin, &amp; my hands theft? what ≈øhal I ≈øay of ≈øuch a body, is he not rather rotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> annointed? whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the Apo≈øtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> ≈øaid with weeping tears, alas &amp; woe be vnto me vnhappy &amp; vnfortunate man, who wil deliuer me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> the ≈øeruitude of this body? would he haue ≈øpoken ≈øuch pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful words if the powers of his body had been annointed with holy oile of loue &amp; charity? the church like a pittiful mother doth annoint vs with the whol≈øome water of bapti≈øme when we be born, &amp; afterward ≈øhe doth wa≈øh and annoint vs vvith loue &amp; charity whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> ≈øhe doth giue vs grace to loue god &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue our neighbors: the fir≈øt vnctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> is to help vs that we do not ≈øin, &amp; the ≈øeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>d to make vs clean of al that which we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ≈øinned. O what ≈ømall need Chri≈øt hath to bee ≈øo many times annointed, nor by the church helped; for from the fir≈øt in≈øtant of his incarnation was annointed, not only the altar of
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:3666:245"/>his mo≈øt holy humanity, to enioy pre≈øe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g>tly the diuine e≈ø≈øence, but al≈øo all the members of his holy body were annointed, becau≈øe they might neuer ≈øinne, nor neuer be ≈øeperated from God. The figure of annointing the altar with all the furniture was ≈øpoke of none but of Chri≈øt, nor fulfilled in none but in Chri≈øt alone, becau≈øe it doth ea≈øily appeare, that as the holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gho≈øt left no part in his ≈øoule nor body, which he did not ≈øan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie and make holy, ≈øo there was no power in his ≈øoule nor body, which to our benefite hee did not imploy.

That which <hi>Dauid</hi> commanded his ≈øonne <hi>Salomon</hi> to doe, was not commanded to one who was deaffe, for if hee did command him to kill two, hee did kill three or foure, that is, the infant <hi>Abdonias,</hi> the captaine <hi>Ioab, Simei,</hi> and the Prie≈øt <hi>Abiathar.</hi> In al his kingdome <hi>Dauid</hi> had no captaine which had done him ≈øo great ≈øeruice, nor no ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant which had loued him better than old <hi>Ioab,</hi> yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thele≈ø≈øe, he had more re≈øpect to reuenge the iniuries done to others, than vnto their ≈øeruices pa≈øt.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Vlnera≈øti cor meum ≈øeror mea, vulnera≈øti cor meum ≈øpon≈øa mea, in vno oculorum tuorum, &amp; in vno crine colli tui.</hi> Cant. 4. as if hee ≈øhould ≈øay, Thou ha≈øt wounded my heart, O my ≈øi≈øter, thou ha≈øt pierced my heart, O my ≈øpou≈øe, and the cau≈øe of my captiuity was, becau≈øe thou didde≈øt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold mee with one of thy eies, and becau≈øe I did behold one of thy haires. <hi>Origen</hi> vpon the≈øe words ≈øayth, Such ≈øweet words and ≈øuch pittifull complaints as the≈øe are, from whence ≈øhould they proceed but from a man ≈øorely greeued, &amp; with heauenly loue greatly enflamed? The louing wordes which Chri≈øt ≈øpeaketh vnto the ≈øoule, and the anxiety and griefe which the ≈øoule vttereth vnto Chri≈øt, who can better declare than the ≈øoule which is familiar with Chri≈øt? Such deepe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, ≈øuch pittifull wounds, ≈øuch true complaints, and griefes ≈øo lamentably vttered, as the≈øe are which are contained vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the≈øe words, how is it po≈øsible for my pen to write, or my heart to ta≈øt of? How ≈øweet our Lord is to the ≈øoule which ≈øeeketh him, and how delightfull vnto the ≈øoule which cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vpon him, and how plea≈øant vnto the ≈øoule which dooth keepe him, is ≈øo high a language, that none is able to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtand, but only that ≈øoule which dooth de≈øerue to ta≈øt of the ≈øame. Fir≈øt of all it is here to be noted, why Chri≈øt dooth call a holy ≈øoule once ≈øi≈øter, and another time ≈øpou≈øe: for if ≈øhe be a ≈øi≈øter ≈øhe cannot be a ≈øpou≈øe, and if ≈øhe be a ≈øpou≈øe ≈øhee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a ≈øi≈øter. The my≈øtery of this ≈øecret is, that ≈øhe is called ≈øpou≈øe becau≈øe of the faith which ≈øhee tooke of Chri≈øt, and
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:3666:252"/>≈øhe is called ≈øi≈øter, becau≈øe of the fle≈øh which Chri≈øt tooke, in ≈øo much that Chri≈øt is our bridegroome in that, that hee is our Creator, and he is our brother in that, that hee is our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. Twi≈øe the bridegroome complaineth to haue beene wounded of his bride, ≈øaying, Thou ha≈øt wounded my heart my ≈øi≈øter, thou ha≈øt wounded my heart my ≈øpou≈øe: for in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpect of two loues hee hath compa≈øsion on her, and in re≈øpect of two loues he ≈øuffered for her, that is, for hauing made her to his likene≈ø≈øe and ≈øemblance, and for hauing redeemed her with his bloud. For Chri≈øt to ≈øay twi≈øe. Thou ha≈øt wounded me, thou ha≈øt wounded me; is to ≈øay, thou ha≈øt been vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the fauour I did to create thee, and thou ha≈øt been vngratefull for the benefite which I did thee in redeeming thee: in≈øomuch that to bee vnthankfull vnto Chri≈øt for the≈øe two benefites, is to wound Chri≈øts heart with two deepe wounds. S. <hi>Barnard</hi> vpon the Canticles ≈øaith, Note well that Chri≈øt doth not ≈øay [thou ha≈øt broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> my head] but [thou ha≈øt pierced my heart] to let vs thereby vnder≈øtand, that all the offences which we commit again≈øt him, and al≈øo all the ≈øerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which wee doe for him, doe reach vntill his heart, as hee doth loue vs with the heart. <hi>An≈øelmus</hi> to this purpo≈øe ≈øayth, Our Lord doth ie≈øt with no man, nor will not bee ie≈øted at by any man, and therevpon he loueth vs with all his heart if we be in ≈øtate of grace, and hateth vs with his heart if we bee in his di≈øgrace. By rea≈øon whereof, there is no offence which we doe commit again≈øt his Maie≈øty, vvhich goeth not to his heart, nor there is no ≈øeruice which we do to him, but he doth keepe it in his heart. <hi>Origen</hi> ≈øayth, The cau≈øe why the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome doth complaine vpon the bride, and not the bride a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the bridegroome is, becau≈øe the ≈øoule hath no cau≈øe to complaine vpon God, and God hath ≈øcar≈øe no cau≈øe to bee plea≈øed with the ≈øoule. The bridegroome complaineth that the bride woundeth him in the heart, becau≈øe that one heart cannot be hurt but of another heart, becau≈øe that that cannot be called a fault, but that which doth determinatly proceed from the will. Then thy heart doth pierce and wound Chri≈øts
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:3666:253"/>heart, when rea≈øon doth teach thee that thou ≈øhoulde≈øt not ≈øinne, and yet notwith≈øtanding thy will dooth determine to ≈øinne, whereof God dooth not ≈øo much hold him≈øelfe iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of that which thou doe≈øt, as of the heart and will with the which thou doe≈øt it. Thou doe≈øt ≈øo many times wound Chri≈øt as thou doe≈øt con≈øent vnto ≈øinne, and therefore hee ≈øayth that thou ha≈øt wounded his heart, becau≈øe his iniuries and offences proceeded from thy heart. It is much to bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that hee ≈øayth not, thou ha≈øt killed my heart, but thou ha≈øt wounded my heart: for ≈øeeing that we ≈øee ≈øome die only becau≈øe his heart is moued &amp; ≈øtirred, it ≈øhould be greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon that they ≈øhould die hauing their heart wounded. If a griefe of the heart be hardly cured, how ≈øhall that heart bee healed which is wounded? If it be ≈øo, that all the wounds in the heart are mortall, and not to bee cured, why doth Chri≈øt ≈øay that his louer had wounded his heart, &amp; not confe≈ø≈øe that he had killed him? By this is knowne the difference betwixt offending God and offending man, for a man dieth with eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wound becau≈øe he will neuer forgiue and pardon, but holy Ie≈øus doth not complaine that they kill him, but onely that they wound him. Giuing vs therby to vnder≈øtand, that at the ≈øame in≈øtant when a ≈øoule doth repent her of her offences, he doth hold him≈øelfe ≈øatisfied for that fault. What ≈øhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of vs, if Chri≈øt ≈øhould ≈øay that wee doe kill him as hee ≈øayth that we doe wound him? What other thing were it to take Chri≈øts life away, but to ≈øinne without hope of mercy? God ≈øpeaking with the Angell ≈øayth, <hi>Interfecisti cor meum,</hi> and ≈øpeaking with man ≈øayth onely, <hi>Vulnera≈øti cor meum,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe the ≈øinne of the Angell had no remi≈øsion, but the ≈øinne of man obtaineth euery day pardon. O good Ie≈øus, O creator of my ≈øoule, how much are wee bound vnto thee in ≈øaying, that we doe wound thee, and not that wee doe kill thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe that by this high ≈øpeech thou doe≈øt let vs vnder≈øtand, that the wounds which we giue thee in the heart, and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences which wee commit again≈øt thee, are as ea≈øily cured as they are ea≈øily amended. Let no man de≈øpaire, let no man be
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:3666:253"/>di≈øcomforted in thinking that he ≈øhall not bee pardoned, and that there is no remedy for his offences; ≈øeeing that the ≈øon of God doth confe≈ø≈øe, that wee haue not wholly ≈ølaine him, but only wounded him: of which wounds hee then beginneth to be cured when wee begin to amend. O infinite goodne≈ø≈øe, O great charity of thine, O my good Ie≈øus, tell mee I pray thee, what didde≈øt thou ≈øee in my ≈øinfull ≈øoule, that thou ≈øhoulde≈øt tru≈øt the weapons in her hands which ≈øhee may wound thee with, and al≈øo the medicines with the which ≈øhee may cure thee? what are the weapons with the which ≈øhe doth wound thee, but the faults which ≈øhee dooth commit again≈øt thee? And what is the medicine with the which ≈øhee dooth cure thee, but only the amendment of her owne life? Chri≈øt ≈øaith further, that the weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> with the which the bride did wound him was one of her eies which ≈øhe had in her head, and with one of her haires which hanged at her throat, ≈øo that her eies ≈øerued her for arrowes, and her hair for bindings. <hi>Origen</hi> vpon this place ≈øayth, O how tender the heart is which is woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the only ≈øight of an eie, and what ≈ømall force and ≈øtrength he hath who is bound with a hair. The heart which is touched of our Lord, although he be ≈øtronger then <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon,</hi> and lighter then <hi>A≈øael,</hi> yet in louing of God and ta≈øting of Gods holy loue, it is ea≈øily taken, and ≈øuffereth him≈øelfe to be bound without re≈øi≈øtance. We haue two eies in our head to ≈øee with, and wee haue two eies in our ≈øoules to loue with, whereof the one is the eie of loue, and the other is the eie of feare, and when our Lord ≈øayth that wee looke vpon him with one eie, hee ≈øayth that ≈øometimes wee ≈øerue him with feare, and ≈øometimes with loue. Men of high per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection doe looke vpon him with the eie of loue, and men of le≈ø≈øer perfection with the eie of feare, and the difference is, that with the ≈øight of the one there is no alteration at all, and with the ≈øight of the other ≈øhe is pre≈øently delighted. What can there be in the world more ≈øweeter to the ta≈øt, or wherin our ≈øoule may receiue greater recreation, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> to fix all our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to behold and look vpon God, and ≈øerue him with all
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:3666:254" rendition="simple:additions"/>our heart. When do we look vpon him with one eie only, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">ÃÑ</g> for loue we ≈øerue him, and not for fear? What can Chri≈øt ≈øpeake more tenderly vnto our ≈øoule, or what more ≈øweeter words can his holy mouth vtter vnto the ≈øoule, than to ≈øay that ≈øhe had wounded him with one eie, and tied him fa≈øt with one haire? O infinite loue of thine my Creator and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, tell me I pray thee if thou be ≈øo ea≈øily ≈øatisfied with a ≈øoule that doth but once behold thee, what wilt thou doe by her which doth behold thee euery day, and ≈øerue thee all her life time? S. <hi>Barnard</hi> ≈øayth, He doth bind God with one haire who thinketh on God and nothing el≈øe, and hee doth wound him with the ≈øight of one eie, who loueth him and no other, ≈øo that it lieth in our owne hands to ≈øerue Chri≈øt and attaine vnto his bli≈ø≈øe and felicitie.</p>
