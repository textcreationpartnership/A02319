         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

They preſented Chriſt before foure ſeats of iudgement the day of his holy paſsion, that is before <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> before <hi>Herod,</hi> before the high prieſts houſes, the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tife <hi>Caiphas,</hi> and the tree of the croſſe before his father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom he ſpake onely, and in the preſence of the others was for the moſt part alwaies ſilent, and that for certaine not without a high miſtery and hidden ſecret. The miſtery then of this ſecret is, that he wold not anſwer, in the firſt two Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunals when they accuſed him of wickedneſſe and ſcandale: but vpon the croſſe where he was an aduocate, he began pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to ſpeake and plead for vs, ſaying. <hi>Pater ignoſce illis,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forgiue them, in ſo much that for to excuſe my offences, he omitteth to anſwere for himſelfe. What meaneth this O good Ieſus, what meaneth this? Thou doeſt not anſwer whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou art ſpoken vnto in that that toucheth thy ſelfe, and in that that concerneth mee doeſt thou anſwere not ſpoken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to? Doeſt thou make interceſsion for my fault, &amp; doeſt thou not remember thy owne life? Who but thou did euer excuſe thoſe which accuſed him, and defend them which condemne
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3666:7"/>him? <hi>Anſelmus</hi> in his meditations ſayth, <hi>O quam ignitum eſt eloquium tuum,</hi> My ſweet Ieſus ſeeing that on the croſſe thou diddeſt excuſe mee which was in the fault, and returnedſt no anſwere for thy ſelf being without fault, the which thou didſt being enflamed with loue, and very full of griefe: Now that thou doeſt intreat, now that thou doeſt craue, why doeſt thou not entreat thy good father that hee would mitigate thy griefes, as well as forgiue ſinners? Haſt thou no pittie of thy owne holy members which are looſed one from another, and haſt thou it towards thy enemies which are not as yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted vnto thee? Seeing thou art aſwell bound to defend the innocent, as make interceſsion for the wicked, why haſt thou no pittie vpon thy owne innocent fleſh, aſwell as of my enormious crimes? <hi>Vbertinus</hi> ſayth, <hi>O quam vehementer eſt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum eloquium tuum,</hi> My good Lord, ſeeing thou doeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him who is culpable, entreateſt without entreaty, forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt without ſatisfaction, heapeſt vp for thoſe which will not repay thee, and alſo dieſt for thoſe which haue put thee to death: Seeing the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> commandeth that the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor ſhould pay a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, foot for foot, eie for eie, and life for life, why doeſt thou O mighty redeemer giue thy hands vnto thoſe which bind the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, thy feet vnto thoſe which pierce them with nailes, thy eies vnto thoſe which make thee blind, and thy life vnto thoſe which take thy life from thee? If thou wilt not reuenge thy iniuries, why doeſt thou not let iuſtice doe iuſtice vpon thy enemies? S. <hi>Barnard</hi> ſayth in a ſermon, from the time that our Sauiour was taken in the garden, vntill hee was crucified on the croſſe, the works which he did were many, but the words which he ſpake were very few; whereby hee gaue vs to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that in time of great vexations and perſecutions, it is fitter for vs to helpe our ſelues with patience than with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence. In this firſt praier which the ſonne made vnto the father, it is to be noted who the father is, what that is that he asketh, of whom he asketh, when he asketh, from whence he asketh, how hee asketh, and for whome hee asketh; for by ſo
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3666:8"/>much the more one buſineſſe is greater than another, by how much the inconueniences are greater which it draweth after it. He who asketh is the ſonne, he of whom he asketh is the father, that which he asketh is pardon, the place fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence hee asketh is the croſſe, the time is when hee dieth, thoſe for whom are his enemies, the maner how is with many teares; in ſo much that a praier offered vvith all theſe circumſtances, ought of great reaſon to be heard. This praier of <hi>Pater ignoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce illis,</hi> Father pardon them, is a very high praier, ſeeing that he vvhich made it vvas the ſonne of God, vvho ſaith, <hi>Si quid petieritis patrem in nomine meo dabit vobis,</hi> And if this bee ſo, how is it poſsible, that the father ſhould not graunt all that which the ſonne requeſteth, ſeeing hee promiſeth to giue all things that ſhall be demanded in his name? If this be a great praier by reaſon of him which maketh it, it is alſo a very great &amp; high praier by reaſon of him vnto whom it is made, which is, <hi>Pater miſericordiaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; deus totus conſolationis,</hi> The father of mercies and the God of all comfort: the vvhich eternall father created vs vvith his power, guideth and gouerneth vs vvith his vviſedome, ſuſtaineth and vpholdeth vs with his eſſence, and forgiueth vs with his elemency, how is it poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that a ſonne vvhich hath ſuch a father, or a father vvhich hath ſuch a ſonne ſhould not grant his demand? This praier of <hi>Pater ignoſce illis,</hi> was alſo very great becauſe of the place vvhere it was made, which was in the mount of Caluarie, and on the altar of the croſſe, vvhere the vvrath of the eternall father was appeaſed, his bleſſed ſonne put to death, the vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked deuil ouercome, the old ſinne forgiuen, and all the world there redeemed. S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> vpon S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſayth, how much the Iewes diſhonoured the holy temple, ſo much Chriſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored the Mount of Caluary; for they made a den of theeues of the houſe of praier, and the ſonne of God made a houſe of praier, of a den of theeues. O good Ieſus what is there now that thou doeſt not make cleane, what doeſt thou not renue, what doeſt thou not ſanctifie, what doeſt thou not make ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſeeing thou wenteſt to the Mount of Caluary to pray for
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:3666:8"/>ſinners, which before was infamous, by reaſon of execution done there vpon malefactors? The ſonne of God praying on the infamous and ſtinking place of the Mount of Caluary, giueth all men licenſe to pray vnto God, where they will, and how they will, and for whome ſo euer they will, becauſe the perfection of praier, doth not conſiſt of the place where wee pray, but of the ſmall or great deuotion with the which wee pray: According vnto that which the Samaritane woman ſaid vnto Chriſt. That many Iews would not pray but within the temple; and it may bee to take away this error wee doe read that the ſon of God did not pray there, but preach only; which our bleſſed Sauiour did becauſe no man ſhould excuſe himſelfe from praier &amp; deuotion, ſaying that the temple was ſhut vp. <hi>Vbertinus</hi> ſaith, that the ſonne of God is not aſhamed to pray, <hi>Pater ignoſce illis,</hi> on the dunghill of the Mount of Caluary; and art thou aſhamed to pray alone in thy houſe? O what a high charge and office the office of meditation and praieris, conſidering that Chriſt his being naked on the croſſe with his handes bound and tied, his feet peirced with nailes, his head crowned with thornes, his mouth ſeaſoned with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neger, did not hinder him to pray, <hi>Pater ignoſce illis,</hi> Father forgiue them: and ſeeing hee pardoned and forgaue with his heart, and praied with his tongue.</p>

Theſe words were not ſpoken
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3666:9"/>voluntarily, nor of euery man, ſeeing they cannot be applied, neither to the nature of mankind nor of angell, becauſe men are not wont to receiue ſtripes and words in their friends hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but in their enemies. The Prophet toucheth a new thing, and a high myſtery, in ſaying that he was whipped and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the houſe of his well-willers, and therefore it is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for vs to lift vp our vnderſtanding, to diſcouer and reach vnto this high ſecret, becauſe that high myſteries are fit on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for heroicall and high perſons. This demand and this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, paſſed on the altar of the croſſe, betwixt the eternall father which asked, and his bleſſed ſonne which anſwered: who [not being content to entreat only for his enemies, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Pater,</hi> Father forgiue them] would alſo haue excuſed them, and take all blame from them, in ſaying, <hi>Neſciunt quid faciunt,</hi> They know not what they doe: the father ſaid vnto him, <hi>Quid ſunt plagae iſtae?</hi> ſo ſaid the father vnto his ſon, which is as much as to ſay, O my ſon if thou doeſt ſay, that none of theſe Iewes, are guiltie and culpable of thy death and paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I pray thee tell me, who made theſe cruell wounds in the midſt of thy tender hands? The ſon anſwered his father, <hi>His plagatus ſum, in domo eorum qui me diligebant,</hi> which is as much as to ſay; O holy and eternall father, I receiued theſe wounds which thou ſeeſt in my tender hands, in the houſe of thoſe which were my friends: and if I be ioifull in receiuing them, why art not thou glad in forgiuing them? Thou knoweſt well O my father, that nothing can be called an iniury in this world, but only that which is done againſt our proper will. If I die by thy commandement, and to obey thy will, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſo it is needfull for the world, why ſhould I call them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies which execute thy commandements? Giue me leaue O my father, giue me leaue ſeeing I muſt die, to ſell my death deerely, giue me leaue, ſeeing I loſe my life to employ it well, which I ſhall thinke well beſtowed, if thou pardon thoſe which take my life from mee, and haue pitie on thoſe which offend thee: for what doth it auaile, that I die for ſinners, if thou wilt not forgiue them their ſinnes? Thou knoweſt O
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3666:9"/>my good father, that by pardoning and ſuffering, the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the vvorld muſt bee vvrought. If thou ſhouldeſt not be ſatisfied vvith the death vvhich I ſuffer, and with the life vvhich I offer thee; in giuing mee another life, I vvould of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it vnto thee, &amp; giuing me another death, I vvould accept it, to the end O my good father, that thou ſhouldſt be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeaſed, and all mankind pardoned. O euerlaſting good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, O infinite charitie, O inſpeakable clemency ſhowne in this anſwere, calling that a houſe of friends vvhich was a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſe of enemies, and going about to excuſe thoſe vvhich he ſhould accuſe, and in purpoſing to appeaſe him, vvhome hee ſhould haue ſtirred vp to vvrath and indignation. <hi>Fulgencius</hi> vpon this place ſayth, Notwithſtanding all the enemies and perſecutors vvhich the ſonne of God had in this vvorld, yet he neuer vſed this vvord Enemie: vvhich is euident by this demand of his fathers, vvho asking him vvhere hee had ben ſo euilly handled and wounded, ſought out a new deuiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he vvould auoid this vvord of enemy, and lay the fault vpon his friend rather than confeſſe that he had any enemies, becauſe God vvas vvont to haue many familiar friends in the houſe of the ſynagogue, vvhich vvere holy men: our bleſſed ſauiour vvould not account of the iniuries vvhich the Iewes did preſently vnto him, nor of the vvounds vvhich they gaue him, but reſpected rather the ſeruices vvhich the old Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arkes had done vnto him. It is greatly to be noted and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that in the anſwere vvhich the ſonne gaue vnto the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he did not ſay that he had been vvounded in the houſe of thoſe vvhich then loued him, but in the houſe of thoſe vvhich vvere vvont to loue him, for hee ſayth, <hi>In domo eorum qui me diligebant,</hi> and not <hi>qui me diligunt,</hi> &amp; yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all this, he doth not only, not call them enemies, but tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his father that they did vnto him the vvorks of friends.

O good Ieſus, O redeemer of my ſoule vvhat humane iudgement, yea vvhat angels vnderſtanding is able to conceaue or reach vnto this, vvhy thou ſhouldeſt rather reſpect old ſeruices, vvhich ordinarily other men forget, than thy owne iniuries vvhich run freſhly from thy blood like ſtreames? Seeing we haue already told you vvho praied, vvhich vvas the ſon; and vnto whome he praied, vvhich vvas the father; and vvhere hee praied, to vvit vpon the croſſe: it is time now to tell you vvhat praier he made, and for whom he praied, for ſeeing the ſonne of God betooke himſelfe to praier in ſuch a narrow extremitie, it is to be thought, that hee entreated ſome great and vveighty matter. <hi>Vbertinus</hi> ſayth, That vvhen the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine vvord vvas nailed vpon the croſſe, as it vvere almoſt dead, hauing his fleſh pierced vvith nailes, &amp; his bowels bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vvith the loue of charitie, forgetting his owne ſelfe, and hauing his enemies in remembrance, lifting vp his holy eies vnto heauen, ſaid, <hi>Pater ignoſce illis, qui neſciunt quid faciunt,</hi> vvhich is as much as to ſay, O my eternall and bleſſed father, in recompence of my comming into the vvorld, preaching thy name, appeaſing thy vvrath, reconciling thee vnto the vvorld, I deſire of thee this one thing for a ſpiritual guerdon, and reward of all my trauailes, that is, that thou vvouldeſt pardon theſe ſinfull Iewes, father I am very vvell pleaſed, that thou vvouldeſt not yeeld vnto my naturall deſire of life, vvhen I praied vnto thee in the garden, if it vvould now pleaſe thee to heare mee in praying for them: for I thinke it a farre greater benefit that they liue in their ſoules, than a hurt vnto me to die in body. <hi>Pater ignoſce illis,</hi> Father forgiue them, for I die becauſe they ſinned, and if I die it is becauſe they may liue: and in ſo difficult a matter as this, it is far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſon that thou haue more regard vnto my new death, than vnto their old fault. Father forgiue them, ſeeing the death vvhich preuailed on the wood, I haue here crucified
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:3666:10"/>with mee vpon the croſſe, the vvhich being ſo it is far greater reaſon, that thou eſteeme more of the charitie vvith the vvhich I die for them, than of their malice vvith the vvhich they put me to death. Father forgiue them, for if thou vvilt puniſh theſe Iewes with all rigour of iuſtice, it will bee but a ſmall puniſhment to condemne them for euer to hell: but if thou doeſt otherwiſe, as there was neuer any wickedneſſe done like vnto this, ſo likewiſe thou ſhalt neuer beſtow thy accuſtomed mercy like as in forgiuing theſe their offences. Father forgiue them, for if my death be ſufficient to redeeme all thoſe which ſhall hereafter be borne, or be already borne, it is not reaſon that theſe vnhappy Iewes ſhould vvant the benefit of it, and ſo much the more becauſe that if my blood be ſhed by thy holy will and conſent it would be reaſon that it ſhould bee well emploied by thee. Forgiue them O my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forgiue them, for ſeeing the partie iniuried (which am I) do pardon the iniury, why wilt not thou O my father par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don that which concerneth thy iuſtice? What hath iuſtice to doe there, where there is no complaint of one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Father forgiue them, ſeeing the time is now come whereof the Prophet ſpeaketh, <hi>Tempus miſerendi deus tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus miſerendi,</hi> Time of forgiuing good Lord, a time of forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing: it is neither iuſt nor reaſonable that rigor ſhould take place there, where mercie by thee hath ben publickely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed. If it be true as true it is, that, <hi>miſericordia &amp; veritas obuiuerunt ſibi,</hi> and alſo that <hi>iuſticia &amp; pax oſculatae ſunt,</hi> Why wilt thou execute iuſtice vpon this people, ſeeing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſayth, that peace and iuſtice haue embraced one the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Father forgiue them, ſeeing I aske it in the end of my life, and intreat thee at the houre of my death, thou muſt thinke my father that it behooueth me very much, that they be pardoned, becauſe that by my example none ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to call himſelfe my ſeruant, in my church, if he doe not reconcile himſelfe firſt vnto his brother. Father forgiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for ſeeing the old law endeth when I ſhal ſay, <hi>Conſummatum eſt,</hi> All is finiſhed; and the new law beginneth when I ſhall
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3666:11"/>ſay, <hi>Commendo ſpiritum meum,</hi> I commend my ſpirit, it would not be reaſonable that vnder the law of Grace, we ſhould co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that any thing ſhould be vnfitting or vnſit, nor that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the law of Loue, wee ſhould permit ranckor and malice. Father forgiue them; for if in the wilderneſſe of <hi>Aaron,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou waſt angry vvith all the Iewes, thou diddeſt forgiue them, and reconcile them vnto thee for no other cauſe but only becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> did offer a little incenſe vnto thee: why wilt thou not forgiue them now, ſeeing I doe now offer for them, not incenſe, but my ſelfe crucified? Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue them, for ſeeing they bee thy creatures by creation, thy clients by law, my children by redemption, my brethren by bloud, my acquaintance by education, my followers in doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and ſo neare of kindred vnto my diſciples; why ſhould I conſent to their loſſe and condemnation? Father forgiue them, ſeeing I came not into the vvorld to procure thee ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but to giue thee new friends, and to take thy old griefes and ſorrowes from thee: for otherwiſe if by my death, this people ſhould remaine in thy diſgrace and hatred, it would ſeeme that my death, would rather moue thee to indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, than appeaſe thy wrath. If my death make not an attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment betwixt you, who is able to doe it? O my good father when thou diddeſt command me to come downe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and alſo to die vpon the croſſe, diddeſt not thou promiſe and agree, that thy anger and my life, and my life and thy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſhould haue an end at the ſame houre? Father forgiue them, and fulfill thy agreement, giue that which thou haſt promiſed, and ſeeing in thy preſence my life is deerer vnto thee than thy anger, I am glad and willing to die, if by that meanes thy ire may bee appeaſed. O bleſſed praier, O holy wiſh and requeſt, neuer heard of before! O happie petition, which thou madeſt ſweet Ieſus in thy laſt houre, wherein thou diddeſt ſhew by deeds all that thou haddeſt preached with words, ſeeing thou diddeſt entreat for thoſe which put thee to death, &amp; aske pardon for thoſe which crucified thee. Let all the praiers bee brought forth, that euer were made
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3666:11"/>in the world, and we ſhall eaſily perceiue, that there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any equall vnto this praier of Chriſts: for there was neuer any which had that intent which hee had, nor asked that which hee asked, nor compaſſed that which hee compaſſed. What did the great Patriarch <hi>Iacob</hi> requeſt of <hi>Laban</hi> his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in law, but only his faire daughter <hi>Rachel</hi> for his ſpouſe? What did the women of Iſraell demaund of the women of Aegypt ſaue only their ſiluer and gold? What did <hi>Anna Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> wife and <hi>Samuels</hi> mother, requeſt of God in the temple, ſauing only that it would pleaſe him to giue her a ſon? What did the Iew maid called <hi>Axa</hi> aske of her father <hi>Calaph</hi> but only the paſture which held water, becauſe the other which hee had giuen her was drie? What did the mother of the Zebedees require of Chriſt, but onely that hee would make them the greateſt lords of his kingdome? Which of all theſe doe aske any thing of God for their enemies, or yet for their friendes? Euery man did aske for that which was fitteſt for his owne turn, euery man ſought for that which was good for himſelfe, no man entreated for his neighbour, no man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred his enemie, no man made interceſsion for another, no man loaded himſelfe with other mens faults. Only the ſon of God made man, praieth for his enemies in the laſt ſupper, ſaying; <hi>Pater,</hi> keepe thoſe which beleeue in me: and praieth alſo vpon the croſſe for his enemies, ſaying: <hi>Pater ignoſce illis,</hi> ſo that like a mercifull lord he defendeth the good, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth the wicked.</p>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3666:12"/>riuer Cobar in the two and twentith chapter of his prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie. And it is as if he would ſay, <hi>Ezechiell</hi> I haue beene many a day angrie with Ieruſalem, and I ſeeke out a holy and a vertuous man, which ſhould put himſelfe like a hedge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt mee and the people of Iſraell, becauſe their offences might not come vnto mee, nor my puniſhment reach vnto them. Wee may inferre of the complaint which our Lord maketh in this place, what great ſcarſitie there was in the ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, of good men, ſeeing he found not one among them all which was worthie to appeaſe the wrath of the Lord, and to helpe and ſuccour the people. The merites of good men are of great force and power before God, for to pardon the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill in their faith, which is eaſily ſeene in all the cities of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which he did pardon for ten good mens ſake, and all the twelue tribes of Iſrael which he pardoned for one alone: but alaſſe neither in the ſynagogue was there found that one, neither in Sodome thoſe ten. To ſay the truth it was no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile that hee was not to be found in all the ſynagogue, with thoſe conditions, which God required in him: for he ought to haue ben a man in diſcretion and not a child, and the Lord himſelfe was to make choice of him and no other, and he was to be an Hebrew and not a Gentile, &amp; he was to put himſelfe a mediator betwixt God and the people, and it was required that he ſhould be partiall on neither ſide. And our Lord was not content onely with this, but that mediator ought alſo to haue deſert and merit in him, to appeaſe Gods indignation, and not ſinne to ſtirre him to wrath. S. <hi>Gregory</hi> vpon <hi>Ezechiell</hi> ſayth, I doubt whether a man endued with theſe conditions, and ſhining with theſe vertues, might bee found amongſt the Angelicall Hierarchies, how much leſſe among humane cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures, becauſe ſuch a one ſhould bee more than man, yea he ſhould be equall with God. <hi>Abraham, Iſaac, Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> and all the letanie of the old and new teſtament, were not equall with God, nor any thing more then men, ſeeing they were borne in ſinne, and attained vnto no diuine ſecret with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it were reuealed vnto them. The ſonne of God only was
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3666:12"/>equall vnto God, and the diuine vvord only vvas more than man, becauſe in him, and in no other, thoſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ditions of a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man were found which God ſought for, and the vertues which ſhould paciſie God his wrath and anger. The firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which God required, was, that this mediator ſhould be a man in wiſdome, and not a child, which may better bee verified in Chriſt than in any other, ſeeing that from the firſt inſtant that he tooke humane fleſh vpon him he ſaw the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine eſſence, and knew as much as hee dooth now in glorie, vvhich is not ſo in other men, ſeeing they are long a bringing vp, and vvaxe old very timely. The ſonne of God vvas alſo an Hebrue of the tribe of Iuda a vvhich vvas the moſt honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſtocke of all the tribes, and hee vvas of Nazareth vvhich vvas a holy land: and he vvas alſo the moſt honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all his kindred. Thirdly, the ſonne of God vvas beſt beloued of his father becauſe of him, and of no other, he ſaid in his baptiſme. <hi>Hic est filius meus dilectus,</hi> as if hee vvould ſay, This is only my lawful child, in him only am I vvel plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, this only is my heire, him onely I doe tender and loue, in him I delight, and take great contentment. Fourthly, the ſon of God vvas a very thicke mud vvall, a cloſe hedge, vvhich put himſelfe betwixt God and the people, vvhen he ſuffered himſelfe to bee crucified vpon the croſſe, vpon the vvhich as ſtrong battelments they diſcharged all the ſinnes vvhich vvere in the vvorld, and all the wrath vvhich God had. O glorious hedge, O happie vvall, O ſtrong vvounds, ſuch vvaſt thou O redeemer of my ſoule, ſeeing thou diddeſt permit, and conſent to put thy ſelfe a mediator betwixt God &amp; man, to the end they ſhould vnlode and put vpon thee all the ſins of the vvorld, and all the vengeance vvhich God vvas to take for them. S. <hi>Gregory</hi> vpon <hi>Ezechiell</hi> ſayth, The ſonne of God only vvas the man he ſought for, this vvas the vvall he required, this vvas the mediator he asked for, this is the paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier of the old quarrell, and of Gods vvrath, this is the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of new grace, and this is the ouerthrower of the old ſinne. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> vpon this place ſayth. The man vvhich God ſought
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:3666:13"/>by <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> who elſe was hee, but the ſon of the liuing God, and our redeemer? Who like vnto an vnexpugnable wall, did put himſelfe boldly betwixt God and vs, ſaying, <hi>Pater ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſce illis,</hi> Father forgiue them. By which words, he did not like, that our ſinnes ſhould come into the ſight of God, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuffered he Gods wrath and vengeance to deſcend vpon vs. <hi>Origen</hi> vpon S. <hi>Marke</hi> ſayth, That whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the two chiefe cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of the ſynagogue, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> perceiued that the Lord began to poure his wrath and anger vpon the people, they went immediatly vnto the tabernacle, the one to pray, and the other to doe ſacrifice to be a mean betwixt God and them; becauſe that otherwiſe, God would haue poured out his anger vpon them, &amp; the Synagogue haue receiued great hurt and detriment. That which happened vnto thoſe two holy men in the deſart happened vnto Chriſt on the mount of Caluarie, who ſeeing the elements to be troubled, and the dead to riſe againe, to reuenge his death and puniſh that nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he made himſelfe a mediator and a ſtikeler betwixt God and them, and praied, <hi>Paterignoſce illis,</hi> as if hee would ſay, Pardon them my father, pardon them; for if thou wilt not pardon them, it will bee a greater griefe vnto me to ſee them loſt, then my paſsion which cauſeth mee to die. What would become of the Iewes then, if Chriſt had not ſaid vnto his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, father forgiue them, and what ſhould betide vs now if he ſhould not ſay. <hi>Pater parce illis,</hi> Spare them father. S. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> ſaith in a ſermon, That this word of <hi>Ignoſce illis,</hi> Forgiue them, is of ſuch a deepe conſideration, that it ſhould neuer be out of a ſinners mouth, nor blotted out of his memory: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the ſonne of God did ſhew his mercy more vnto vs in two things the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in al the reſt: that is, in the pardon which he got vs of his father, and in the bloud which he ſhed for vs on the croſſe. <hi>Anſelmus</hi> reaſoning with Chriſt ſayth, What doeſt thou crie for, what doeſt thou aske, what doeſt thou in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat for, what wilt thou, what ſeekeſt thou, what ſaieſt thou to thy father O good Ieſus, what ſaieſt thou? I intreat O my father, that thou wouldeſt forgiue them, becauſe they know
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:3666:13"/>not what they do, and that thou wouldeſt load my fleſh with thy anger; and I intreat that there remaine nothing vntecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled vnto thee, becauſe that my redemption would ſeem vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect and inſufficient, if there ſhould remaine in any a fault to bee redeemed, and in thy ſelfe any anger to puniſh vs. O what an enflamed charity, what a wonderfull example, what incredible patience, what entire loue thou diddeſt ſhew vs O ſweet Ieſus in this ſpeech of, Father forgiue them, the which thou diddeſt vtter not for an eaſe to thy griefe, but in fauour of thy perſecutors! O what infinite goodneſſe, what vnſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able clemencie, what ſtrange charitie doth ſhine this day in thee O my Ieſus and ſauiour, ſeeing thou doeſt looſe thoſe which bind thee, pleadeſt for thoſe which diffame thee, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateſt for thoſe which accuſe thee, excuſeſt thoſe which blame thee, and pardoneſt alſo thoſe which will kill thee! What meaneth this O good Ieſus, what meaneth this? doeſt thou pray for them at the very inſtant which they blaſpheme thee, mocke thee, and laugh thee to ſcorne? They haue pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thee with a ſpeare, and yet doeſt thou giue them an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quittance and a releaſe of the blow? What mortall man can praiſe himſelfe or boſt to haue done that which thou haſt done, that is to craue pardon for murderers before they haue confeſſed their fault, and ſeeke to releaſe them before they haue repented? They will not returne into the citie before thou haſt yeelded vp the ghoſt, and wilt not thou die before thou haſt firſt pardoned them? Who euer ſaw or heard any thing like vnto this; to wit, that pardon ſhould proceed firſt out of his bleſſed bowels, before the blood ſhould end to iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue out of his tender vaines? Doeſt thou not remember to aske a ſepulchre for thy body, and doeſt thou remember to aske forgiueneſſe and mercie for thoſe which crucified thee? O ſweet Ieſus, O my ſoules glorie, who but thou could haue the breath going out of his body, and <hi>Ignoſce illis</hi> Pardon them in his mouth? To defend thy ſelfe couldeſt not thou open thy mouth, and to excuſe thy enemies couldſt not thou keepe it ſhut? S. <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> ſayth, The ſonne of God onely
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3666:14"/>was he, who on the altar of the croſſe, inſpeaking theſe words, Father forgiue them, coupled, ioined, and handfaſted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, pittie and cruelty, the offence and mercie, anger and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, hatred and loue, killing and pardoning. With as great reaſon (ſayth <hi>Hilarius</hi>) we can now ſay, <hi>Vbi ſunt irae tuae anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quae,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaid, <hi>Vbi ſunt miſericordiae tuae anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quae,</hi> ſeeing we bee certaine that from the houre that the ſon of God died vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the croſſe, we may cal him, <hi>Pater miſericor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> as the Synagogue called him, <hi>Deus vltionu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> The God of reuenge. No man ought to diſtruſt Chriſts goodneſſe and mercie, although he haue ben neuer ſo great a ſinner, ſo as he liue and die a Chriſtian: for ſeeing he pardoned thoſe which would not bee pardoned, hee will much rather pardon thoſe which aske for pardon. S. <hi>Barnard</hi> as if hee were in a maze ſayth thus vnto Chriſt; O good ſauiour, O my ſoules delight, if thou wilt pardon thy death, why doeſt thou pardon it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou bee dead? they tooke thy life from thee, to the end that thou ſhouldeſt forget ſuch a greeuous iniury done vnto thee, and make no reckoning to be reuenged. It is a tollerable thing to forgiue the iniury done vnto thy ſelf; but why doeſt thou forgiue the iniury done vnto thy ſorrowfull mother and thy bleſſed father, not calling the parties offended vnto it? Thy mouth is now ready to receiue vineger, thy perſon to be mocked, thy ſide to bee pierced, thy bodie to bee buried, and yet doeſt thou make interceſsion for that wicked people? Doeſt thou entreat for thoſe which crucifie thee, and doeſt thou not remember thoſe which weepe by thee? Now that thou haſt pitie on the offences of the ſynagogue, why haſt thou not alſo compaſsion of the tears of thy bleſſed mother? S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> vpon the paſsion of our Lord ſayth: All things end with thee, and all forſake thee O ſweer Ieſus vpon the altar of the croſſe, ſauing only thy patience, with the which thou did deſt ſuffer thy torments, and thy charitie with the which thou diddeſt forgiue thy enemies, ſeeing thou doeſt pray for thoſe which crucifie thee, entreat for thoſe which blaſpheme thee, hold thy peace againſt thoſe which ſpit on thee, excuſe
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:3666:14"/>thoſe which accuſe thee, and pardon thoſe which pardon not thee. O my redeemer, what a pitifull heart haſt thou, that conſidering how the Iewes themſelues gaue thee licence to take reuengement on them: ſaying, <hi>Sanguis eius ſuper nos,</hi> His bloud vpon vs, yet thou diddeſt not only not vſe this libertie giuen thee, but forſookeſt it, &amp; there pardoned thy iniury. O how contrary theſe two ſpeeches are, <hi>Sanguis eius ſit ſuper nos,</hi> Let his bloud fall vpon vs, and <hi>Ignoſce illis,</hi> Pardon them: ſeeing that by the firſt the Iewes craue puniſhment of God, and in the laſt Chriſt asketh pardon of his father for them: in ſo much that the bloud of Chriſt which they asked to bee againſt them, the ſon of God asketh that it may be for them! What haſt thou to do O good ſauiour, what haſt thou to do with the Iews (ſayth <hi>Vbertinus</hi>) and hangmen and torturers? They goe about to condemne thee, and thou to ſaue them; they to accuſe thee, and thou to excuſe them; they to carry thee to <hi>Pilate</hi> to bee condemned, and thou to thy father that they may be pardoned; they to ſay, <hi>crucifige, crucifige,</hi> crucifie him, crucifie him, and thou to ſay, <hi>Ignoſce, ignoſce,</hi> Pardon them, Pardon them. At what time the ſon of God hanging vpon the croſſe, praied on one ſide vnto his father, and on the other ſide the Hebrews praied <hi>Pilate;</hi> there was a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict betwixt Gods iuſtice and mercie: for iuſtice willed the praier of <hi>Sanguis eius,</hi> Let his bloud fall vpon vs, to be heard, and contrary mercy forbad it, and would haue <hi>Pater ignoſce illis,</hi> but in the end mercie had the vpper hand, and reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had no part therein. Whoſe heart ſaith <hi>Bonauenture</hi> would not bleed, and who would not loue thee O good Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, to ſee thee ſay to thy father, my father forgiue them, and not my father examine them, and to ſee that thou doeſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without asking, yeeldeſt vnto them without entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and pardoneſt them without amendment? It is ſuch a high myſterie ſayth S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> and a hidden Sacrament, to ſee the ſonne of God releaſe iniurie with mercie and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie, and not puniſh their crime with reuenge, and that the praier of <hi>Ignoſce illis,</hi> Forgiue them, preuailed againſt that of

                     </gap>,</hi> ſayth the Apoſtle in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the Hebrewes, chap. 5. as if hee would ſay: When the ſonne of God was crucified: vpon the tree of the croſſe, hee made many requeſts vnto his father, &amp; with many ſupplications entreated him, praying vnto him with a loud voice, and pouring down many tears before him. This praier was well heard of the eternall father, and very acceptable vnto his diuine clemencie, partly becauſe hee who praied was a perſon worthy of great reuerence, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe the praier which he made was founded vpon great pitie and mercie. It appeareth well that he which praied was of an excellent and perfect condition, and hee very mighty vnto whom he praied, and that which hee praied of great merit, and the manner which hee obſerued in praier a perfect platforme of praier, ſeeing that the Apoſtle in this place laieth down ſuch high conditions of this praier which Chriſt made vpon the croſſe. Whereof although much be ſpoken, yet there remaineth much more not ſpoken of. Firſt then he ſaith that Chriſt praied once on the croſſe, becauſe he ſaith, <hi>Cum clamore,</hi> with a crie; and with a high and loud voice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſaith, <hi>valido,</hi> ſtrong; and that with tears <hi>Cum lachri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis;</hi> and that hee praied and offered his praier at the ſame time vnto his father; and that the quality of the praier was
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:3666:15"/>to entreat and beſeech, <hi>preces &amp; ſupplicationes;</hi> and that his praier was heard of his father at that very inſtant when hee made it, becauſe hee ſayth, <hi>&amp; exanditus eſt pro ſua reuerentia.</hi> The condition and qualitie of the praier which the ſonne of God made vpon the croſſe, which the Apoſtle toucheth here, is very great and worthy to bee marked and obſerued with great heed, and followed with great diligence: for if we faile in any one of theſe conditions, we are ſaid rather to crie out then to pray. <hi>Theophilus</hi> vpon the Apoſtle ſayth, That when the Apoſtle ſaith that the ſonne of God praied with a loud voice vpon the croſſe, hee meaneth that hee offered and directed his praier with all his heart, and with all his will vnto God only, and vnto no other. For to ſay the truth, hee is ſaid to pray aloud, whoſe mind is not diſtracted and drawne into many thoughts. When the Apoſtle ſaith that Chriſt praied aloud on the croſſe and with a ſtrong voice, he letteth vs vnderſtand with what a feruent deſire and great deuotion, he praied: for there is nothing requeſted aloud and by crying out, which is not either through abundance of loue, or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much griefe. Both together forced Chriſt to crie out vpon the croſſe, that is, the great loue he bare vnto his friends, and the ouermuch paine he ſuffered in his members. When the Apoſtle ſayth, That the ſonne of God offered vp praiers and ſupplications vpon the altar of the croſſe, hee declareth, as <hi>Theophilactus</hi> ſayth, That the praier <hi>ignoſce illis</hi> was exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto the good and vnto the bad: in ſo much that for his enemies he offered praiers for the pardon of their ſinnes, and for his friends hee offered vp oblations for to confirme them in his grace. As the ſonne of God was Lord ouer all men and died for all men, ſo vpon the croſſe he praied for all men. For if the wicked had need of him to help them to riſe, the good alſo had need of his helpe to keep them from falling. <hi>Anſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> in his meditations ſayth, That when the Apoſtle ſayth, that the ſonne of God was not content to pray only with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, but alſo offered vp that praier vnto his owne father, it is to let vs vnderſtand, that for the ſauing of all the world hee
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:3666:16"/>offered vp his paines and ſorrowes for a recompence, his life for a ſatisfaction, his perſon for a reward, his bloud for a price, and his ſoule for a ſacrifice. It is alſo to bee weighed, that the ſonne of God made not this holy praier of <hi>Pater ignoſce illis,</hi> Father forgiue them, ſitting but vpright, not being at libertie but bound, not in a low voice but aloud, not laughing but weeping, &amp; that which is moſt to be maruelled at; the words that he praied with, were very few, but the tears he bathed them with, were very many. O good Ieſus, O my ſouls plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, who could be worthy to ſtand at the foot of thy croſſe, to ſee how thy bloud ran from the thornes, and thy tears flow from thy eies, in ſo much that at the ſame hour and moment, thou diddeſt water the earth with tears, and pierce the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens with ſighes! O what a ſacred word was that, O what a holy praier was <hi>Pater ignoſce illis,</hi> Father forgiue them, ſeeing that it was made by the ſonne of God vpon the altar of the croſſe accompanied with ſighes, waſhed with the bloud of Chriſt, and offered vp with the tears of the redeemer! Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the ſonne of God requeſted the greateſt matter of his father and of the greateſt weight that euer was demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him, that is to wit, Pardon of his precious death, yet the tears which hee ſhed were ſo many, and the loue ſo great with the which he asked it, that if he had asked a greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of him, his father would neuer haue denied it him. S. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſill</hi> ſayth, O what great hurt ſinnes bring vnto vs, conſidering that for to lighten vs of them, and obtaine pardon for them, it was needfull for Chriſt to pray vnto his father for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and offer oblation, and crie out, and ſuffer his bloud to bee ſhed, and tears to poure downe from his eies, ſo that thou O good Ieſus diddeſt buy my great offences by the weight of thy bloud &amp; tears. Our Lord when he praied for his enemies vpon the croſſe, taught vs what forme and faſhion wee ought to keepe when wee pray, that is, to ſhed bloud from our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and fall tears fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our eies. The ſon of God wept when he praied for his enemies, and art not thou aſhamed to laugh and talke, when thou praieſt for the remiſsion of thy ſinnes? Yea
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:3666:16"/>and if thou canſt not weep in thy praiers, yet tel me why thou doeſt talke ouermuch? <hi>Barnard</hi> ſayth, That it is more then a ieſt, rather then a praier, if at one time thou wouldeſt pray and talke: for if thou bee not attentiue vnto that that thou praieſt, neither will our Lord be vnto that that thou deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt. <hi>Defecerunt prae la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I had ſuch great compaſst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſee all the Iewes led captiue vnto Babilonia, that my eies with very weeping loſt their ſight. And indeed there is no greater token that a man is in true charity, then to ſee him haue compaſsion of other mens hurts; and therevpon it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth that good men weepe ſooner for the wicked then for themſelues; the which happened alſo vnto Chriſt vpon the croſſe, who wept firſt for his enemies, before they wept for their owne ſinnes. It is a very proper thing vnto the choſen people of God to weepe a like for other mens harmes, and for their owne; becauſe it is the propertie of true Chriſtian charitie, to take as great griefe to ſee his brother loſt, as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ſee himſelfe ſaued. One of the greateſt priuiledges that good men haue is, that euen as they merit in taking com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ioy of the good that is done to good men, ſo they are greeued at the hurt which falleth vnto euill men, in ſo much that the good man and the iuſt reapeth profit &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of euery mans conuerſation. Who doubteth but that the lamentation which Chriſt made vpon the croſſe, was far greater then that which <hi>Ieremie</hi> made on the Mount Sion? But now it is to be vnderſtood that <hi>Ieremy</hi> wept for one peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple onely, and the ſonne of God for all the vniuerſall world. <hi>Ieremy</hi> wept only tears from his eies, but the ſon of God wept tears from his eies and ſhed bloud from his vains.

It is not neceſſary to expound this glorious figure, vnto thoſe which are curious in the ſcriptures, ſeeing al this was fulfilled literally in our good Ieſus. Yet notwithſtanding, we will ſay

What did it mean that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was enuied of his owne proper brothers, but that the ſon of God was hated of al the Iews? Who was ſold vnto the Iſmalites like <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> but the bleſſed Ieſus, who was alſo bought with money? Who like vnto <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was caſt into priſon, becauſe hee would not commit adultery with his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris, but only the ſonne of God, which was condemned vnto death becauſe he would not conſent to ſinne with the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue? who like vnto <hi>Ioſeph</hi> did pardon the manſlaughter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The pardon which Chriſt gaue his enemies, was of greater value the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that which <hi>Ioſeph</hi> gaue vnto his brothers, becauſe without compariſon, it is a greater miſchiefe to take ones life fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſell his perſon. O how rightly may the ſon of God ſay vnto the Iews which killed him, <hi>Vos cogitastis de me malum, ſed deus vertit illad in bonum.</hi> You thought todo me hurt, but God doth turne it to my good, conſidering that they thought at one time to put him to death vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the croſſe, and take all power from him vpon earth! but hee maugre theirmalice roſe the third day, and like vnto another <hi>Ioſeph</hi> had al power giuen vnto him vpon earth, and in heauen. You O yee Iews <hi>Cogitaſtis de me malum,</hi> When you bereaued me of my life, but my bleſſed father did turne it to my good, when at the ſame time my life ended, the Synagogue was buried, and the Church tooke her beginning.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:3666:18"/>much more good to the innocent children, when hee cauſed their throats to bee cut, then if hee had cauſed them to haue ben kept and brought vp.

It is here now to bee weighed how it can be true, that the ſonne of God was heard of his father as S. <hi>Paule</hi> ſayth, <hi>Pro ſua reuerentia.</hi> Seeing that God anſwered him no one word at all? For the better vnderſtanding of this point, it is to bee preſuppoſed, that in ſome requeſts which were made vnto the ſonne of God, if he would not yeeld vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that which was demanded, he anſwered them preſently by word, but when it pleaſed him to condiſcend vnto their peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he performed it with deed without any word ſpeaking, we haue example of both theſe in the Zebedeans his couſins, vnto whom he anſwered, <hi>Neſcitis quid petatis,</hi> You know not what you aske: &amp; when the great <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> ſent to know of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:3666:18"/>Chriſt, <hi>Es tu qui venturus eſt?</hi> He anſwered no one word vnto the Embaſsie more, then that he began immeadiately before the Embaſſadors to work ſuch great miracles, that they knew by them that he was the Meſsias promiſed vnto the Iewes. When the collectors of the tributes of Capernaum ſaid vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Ieſus that hee was to pay his Didrachma, which was the tribute due vnto the king, he anſwered them no word at all, but ſent S. <hi>Peter</hi> vnto the ſea, and of that which the diſciple fiſhed the maiſter pared his tribute. To applie this vnto our purpoſe, wee ſay that what magnificency Chriſt vſed vnto <hi>Iohus</hi> deſciples, and vnto the rent-gatherers of Capernaum, the ſelfeſame vſed the father towards his proper ſon on the croſſe, not anſwering him by word vnto <hi>Pater ignoſce illis,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forgine them; but by deed forgiuing the wicked their offences, if they would at any time be ſorry and repent them of their ſinnes, and by confirming the good in grace. <hi>Beda</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Luke</hi> ſayth, That the praier which the ſonne of God made was not mad in vaine, conſidering that by the merit of that praier, and by him who praied it, all our praiers both are, and haue been heard: and for this cauſe the Apoſtle ſayth, <hi>Quòd offerebat oblationes &amp; preces,</hi> Becauſe hee praied for all men, and in the name of all men; and ſo he wept for all, and in the name of all. O good Ieſus, O glory of my ſoule, what doe I want if I doe not want thee, and what haue I not, ſaith <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> if I haue thee? I haue and poſſeſſe thee O my good Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, ſeeing that I am partaker of thy praiers, I haue part in thy teares, I haue thy gifts in pledge, I am the ſucceſſor of thy ſorrowes, and heire apparant vnto thy ſweatings. <hi>Damaſcen</hi> ſayth as the Apoſtle doth: <hi>Exauditus eſt proſua reuerentia,</hi> Chriſt was heard vpon the croſſe, ſeeing that by the merites of, Father forgiue them, the Centurion immeadiately there ſaid, <hi>Vere hic erat filius dei,</hi> Truly this was the ſonne of God, and the good theefe alſo ſaid, <hi>Domine memento mei,</hi> Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me In whoſe power ſaith <hi>Fulgentius<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:3666:19"/>ſtrike their breaſts, and ſome ſay, This man was iuſt? By the merite of this holy praier, the Apoſtles conuerted three thouſand men in one day, and fiue thouſand another day: by reaſon that the ſonne of God had gotten pardon for the excommunicated ſynagogue, glorious S. <hi>steuen</hi> was bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, holy <hi>Paul</hi> conuerted, and the good <hi>Matthew</hi> called to be an Apoſtle. O what a difference there is betwixt the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which Chriſt made in the garden, &amp; that which he made vpon the croſſe: in the one heeſwet blood, and in the other he ſhed teares; in the one he praied that the bitter challice might paſſe, and in the other pardon for the ſynagogue: and that which Ieſus praied for himſelfe was denied him, &amp; that which hee praied for others was graunted him: In ſo much that his bleſſed father had more pitie on the ſinnes of that people, than on the fleſh of his owne ſonne. O great goodnest O infinit charity? The Sonne of God is in the garden alone, hee is proſtrate on the ground giuing vp his ghoſt, and yet ready for a new combat, his blood iſſueth from all the pores of his body, he praieth thriſe for himſelfe, and thou wilt not heare him, and when he praieth for his enemies doeſt thou heare him at the firſt word? Why doſt thou not graunt him his requeſt, ſeeing that when hee praied vpon the croſſe for his enemies, he called thee nothing but Father; but when he praied in the garden alone for himſelfe, he called thee, My Father, which is a ſweet word, and a word of a gentle and courteous ſonne. What would become of vs (ſaith S. <hi>Ierome</hi>) if Chriſt ſhould not in his glory aboue, repeat that word vnto his father, <hi>Pater ignoſce illis,</hi> Father forgiue them? Chriſt ſaid once only, Father forgiue mine enemies, and he repeateth it a thouſand thouſand times in heanen for his Chriſtians: for euen as wee neuer ceaſe from ſinning, ſo the ſonne of God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ceaſeth to pray for vs. Saint <hi>Steuen</hi> did not ſee Chriſt ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by his father, but on foote; and the reaſon was, becauſe that at that inſtant when S. <hi>Steuen</hi> fell downe on his knees to pray for his enemies, Chriſt roſe immediatly alſo to pray and make interceſsion for them: ſo that that praier which Saint
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:3666:19"/>
                  <hi>Steuen</hi> made here vpon earth, our ſweet Ieſus preſented pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently vnto his father in heauen. It is deeply here to be wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Chriſt did not ſay, Lord forgiue them, but, Father forgiue them; becauſe this word <hi>Lord</hi> is a fearefull word, but this word <hi>Father</hi> is a word of ioy: and therefore when one man calleth another Father, it ſeemeth that hee doth bind him to anſwere him friendly, and not to deny him any thing that he demandeth. Wee ſhall find often in holy ſcripture, that when God was angry with the Hebrewes, hee ſaid al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies, <hi>Ego Dominus qui loquor vobis,</hi> I am the Lord which ſpeake vnto you: but when he would as it were flatter them and make much of them, he alwaies ſaid vnto them, <hi>Ego ero illis in patrem,</hi> I will be a father vnto them: that is, that hee would deale with them like a pitifull father, and not like a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Lord. In ſo much that this word <hi>Pater</hi> Father, bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth loue, and this word <hi>Lord</hi> bringeth feare. Alwaies when the ſonne of God made any great praier or asked any great fauour at his fathers hands, hee began his petition with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, O iuſt father, O holy father, making reckoning that by calling him father, nothing ſhould be denied him which was his ſonne. If Ieſus Chriſt ſhould haue begun his praier with Lord, as he began it with Father, it would haue ſeemed that he had called vpon Gods iuſtice &amp; power, &amp; not vpon his wil &amp; mercy: &amp; therfore in ſaying, Father, he intreated him that hee would not iudge as a Lord of iuſtice, but like a father of mercy. O depth of all goodnes! O bowels full of charity! what els didſt thou meane when thou beganneſt thy petition with Father, but that thou wouldeſt giue him to thy enemies for a father who is thine owne proper father? what goodnes in all the world can be equall vnto thine, or what like charity can be found, ſeeing thou art the plaintife &amp; the party offended, yet thou gaueſt him vnto thy enemies for a mercifull father, whom thou ſhouldſt haue giuen for a rigorous iudge? Then let vs conclude, that when the ſonne ſaid vnto his father, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ignoſce illis,</hi> that at one time he praied vnto him that hee would forgiue them their ſinnes, &amp; that at the ſame time hee would vouchſafe to take them for his children.</p>

I know not O mother the Synagogue, what I haue done againſt thee, nor wherin I haue offended thee, &amp; yet thou haſt gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid mee from my childhood, thou haſt perſecuted mee from my manhood, thou haſt defamed mee, euer ſince I began to preach vnto thee, and in the ſweeteſt time of al my life, thou haſt crucified mee. But this is nothing O mother Synagogue, this is nothing in compariſon of that, that thou diddeſt lay all thy ſinnes vpon my ſhoulders, which neuer had loſt their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, nor neuer done vnto thee any iniury. <hi>Supra dorſum meum,</hi> And ſinners haue built vpon my backe, ſeeing that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> hath caſt his diſobedience vpon me, <hi>Eue</hi> her gluttony, <hi>Cain</hi> her ſonne his murder, king <hi>Dauid</hi> his adultery, the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <hi>Roboam</hi> his Idolatrie, and all the Synagogue her malice. Is it not true that ſinners haue built vpon my backe, ſeeing that I muſt be puniſhed and pay for all the offences that the ſinfull Iewes committed? The Iewes would willingly haue loaden Chriſt on both his ſhoulders, that is they would haue caſt vpon him both the paine and the offence: but good Ieſus tooke vpon him the puniſhment like a redeemer, but char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged not himſelfe with the guilt of ſinne like an offender. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, That the ſonne of God doth not complaine, that they burdened both his ſhoulders, but
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:3666:20"/>only one, ſeeing he ſaith, <hi>Supra dorſum</hi> Vpon my backe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though his enemies would haue ouercharged and wearied them both, by killing his humanitie, and darkening his diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, by blotting his fame and credite and hindering his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; but our mighty redeemer ſuffered them onely to lay the puniſhment on him, and take his life from him. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſayth, That ſinners build vpon one ſhoulder only, when they haue no other goodneſſe in them, but the bare name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians only: and iuſt men build vpon both his ſhoulders when they are at one time both Chriſtians and vertuous men. Thou muſt know (brother) that in the law of Chriſt it is not ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that a man be called a Chriſtian, vnleſſe he be alſo ſuch a one indeed. Sinners build vpon one of Chriſts ſhoulders onely, when they ſerue God in wiſh and deſire onely, and ſerue the world with all their might and power, which is a mean rather to condemne them then to ſaue them: for in the Church of God there are many condemned by good wiſhes &amp; deſires, but not one by good workes. Chriſt complaineth, that curſed Heretikes doe build vpon one ſhoulder, when they confeſſe only his humanitie, &amp; take away his diuinity; which is great wickedneſſe &amp; falſhood: for he is as true a God as he is a man and as true man as he is true God. Chriſts complaint of the Synagogue doeth not end here, but hee ſaith further, <hi>Et prolong auerunt iniquitatem ſuam:</hi> as if he would ſay, Thou was not content, O ingrateful Synagogue, to impute thy of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence vnto mee, and lay all the puniſhment due for it vpon my backe, but thou haſt alſo prolonged thy naughtineſſe and perſeuered in thine infidelity, heaping ſinne vpon ſinne, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice vpon malice, enuie vpon enuie, and idolatry vnto idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. When did the forſaken Iewes prolong their iniquitie, but when at the foot of the croſſe, they were nothing forrie to haue crucified Chriſt, but were grieued to ſee him riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine? <hi>S. Barnard</hi> ſayth, that Chriſt had great reaſon to ſay that the Iewes had prolonged their iniquitie, becauſe that at the time of his paſsion, for the better reuengement vnto their malicious hearts, and the more to torment Chriſts bleſſed
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:3666:21"/>members, they would haue been glad that day had been lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and that Chriſts life had continued a longer time. The hatred which thoſe wicked Iewes bate vnto Chriſt was ſo great, that ſometimes they deſired nothing more then to ſee him yeeld vp the ghoſt, and ſometime they were neuer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied and full in doing him iniury, inſomuch that if they did crucifie him with their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, they did alſo crucifie him much more with their hearts. Wee ſhould haue great compaſsion vpon the Iewiſh nation which doe prolong their iniquity vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the end of the world: for as the Apoſtle ſayth, the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue ſhall neuer be all lightened vntill all the Gentiles bee conuerted. It may be ſaid not only of the Hebrewes, but alſo of many Chriſtians, that <hi>Prolong auerunt iniquitatem ſuam,</hi> who in ſtead of amending themſelues, goe on euery day em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing themſelues, ſo that they are like vnto thoſe which are ſick of the dropſie, who the more they drinke the more they thirſt; ſo they the more they ſinne the greater luſt they haue to ſinne. And as Chriſt with great reaſon ſaid, that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes did prolong their iniquitie againſt him, with the like reaſon may they ſay of Chriſt, that towards them he prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his mercy, ſeeing he was as haſtie in procuring their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, as they were in cauſing his paſsion. What ſhold become of me O ſweet Ieſus, what ſhould become of me ſaith <hi>Anſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> if as euery day I adde naughtineſſe to naughtineſſe, and ſo prolong my iniquitie, thou diddeſt not adde goodnes vnto goodneſſe, and ſo prolong mee thy <hi>miſericordiam?</hi> O ſweet Ieſus and my ſoules delight, of whom may it ſo truly be ſaid as of thee, that thou haſt prolonged thy mercy, ſeeing that thou waſt vpon the croſſe as it were gaping for death, and yet pardoning thy enemies? And although I doe euery day pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long my iniquity, and thou euery moment prolong thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, notwithſtanding thy mercy exceedeth my iniquitie: for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe my ſorrowfull ſoule ſhould long agoe haue knowne what thy rigorous iuſtice had beene. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith vpon the paſsion of our Lord, that hee hath much more prolonged his mercy, ſeeing hee ſaid not in his praier, Father forgiue them if
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:3666:21"/>thou wilt, but abſolutely that hee would forgiue them; and that not by the rigour of iuſtice due vnto them, but by the ſole mercy of him which made the petition. Behold then O my ſoule, behold that with greater deuotion &amp; affection the ſonne of God praied for thee vpon the croſſe than hee did for himſelfe in the garden, ſeeing that he ſaid there, Father if thou wilt, let that chalice paſſe; but on the croſſe he ſaid not If thou wilt, but Father forgiue them. In ſo much that it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that hee left the care of his paſsion vnto the will of his father, but the pardon of his enemies hee deſired preſently to be giuen. What meaneth this O ſweet Ieſus, what meaneth this? It ſeemeth that thou doeſt put it in conſultation whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou ſhalt die or not, ſaying vnto him Father if thou wilt; and doeſt thou not giue thy father leaue to thinke whether he ſhall pardon that wicked people or not, but that he ſhould there preſently forgiue them? The ſonne of God ſaith vnto his father (as <hi>Gregory</hi> reports) Father forgiue them, and not If thou wilt, becauſe we ſhould vnderſtand that when wee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue and be reconciled vnto our enemies, we ſhould doe it ſo ſincerely and heartily, and with ſuch good wil that we ſhould neuer turne our face from them, nor neuer deny them our communication. I will not (ſaith <hi>Hugo</hi>) call that a Chriſtian forgiuing, when we forgiue our enemy vnder condition neuer to ſpeake vnto him, nor goe by his gate, nor dwell where hee hath to doe: for our redeemer excepted no condition in the pardon of his paſsion. It is alſo deepely to bee weighed, that the ſonne of God did not ſay vpon the croſſe, Father forgiue him, but Father forgiue them: That is, he asked forgiueneſſe not for one in particular, but for all the whole world in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall. Whereof it is inferred that ſeeing hee praied for all, that there was ſinne in all. When Chriſt ſaid Pardon them and not pardon him, he gaue cauſe of great hope vnto all ſinners, that they ſhould bee pardoned by him, ſeeing hee forgot not to redeeme any, nor to pardon any man, nor leaue out any man not ſpoken for of his father, but made all men partakers of his paſsion. As the ſonne of God ſaid vnto his father, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don

And he ſaith further, that the cauſe why Chriſt ſaid vnto his father, Pardon them, and not pardon him, was becauſe our good Lord is ſo liberall in giuing and ſo noble in pardoning, that he cannot forgiue any one ſinne alone, if there remaine any other hidden offence in the ſinner. Factious and enuious men are wont to pardon ſome of their enemies, &amp; not other ſome: but the ſonne of God for a certainty dooth not ſo, but he would forgiue all men tog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ther, and redeeme all men togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaid not of Chriſt, behold him who taketh away the ſinne of the world; but ſaid behold him who taketh away the ſinnes of the world. He ſaid not vnto <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> thy ſinne is releaſed, but thy ſinnes are forgiuen thee: In ſo much that in matter of ſinnes God cannot but either wholly winck at them, or wholly pardon them. For as S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ſayth, No man euer heard the ſonne of God ſay, I pardon thee ſuch a ſinne or this ſinne or that ſinne, but hee alwaies ſaid I par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thee all thy ſinnes, and therevpon praying vpon the croſſe vnto his father, hee did not ſay Pardon him, but ſaid Father pardon them. For it ſeemed vnto him, that the value of the bloud which hee ſhed, was of ſuch price, that thoſe for whome hee died were but few, although hee died for thoſe which were abſent, as well as for thoſe which were preſent, for the quicke and for the dead, for thoſe which were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy paſt and for thoſe which were to come, for the iuſt and for the ſinners; &amp; that one drop of his bloud which he ſhould ſhed, would bee ſufficient to redeeme a thouſand of worlds: and if this were ſo, what reaſon had hee to beſtow it vpon one
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:3666:22"/>alone, ſeeing there did abound for all the world? The ſonne of God debated not the matter, nor plaied not the huckſter with his father in contending, how much bloud ſhall I giue thee for their pardon; becauſe he would let vs vnderſtand in this, that he paied very well, yea and repaied for al the ſinnes which were forgiuen. For to conclude, all the ſinnes in the world might haue ben numbred, but the price of the bloud of Chriſt could not bee valued. O good Ieſus! O my ſoules hope, if in fauour of great ſinners thou diddeſt ſay, Father forgiue them, why doeſt thou not ſay in my behalfe who am a great ſinner, <hi>Pater ignoſce illi,</hi> Forgiue him? If the Iewes haue beene vngratefull towards thee for the miracles which thou diddeſt amongſt them, haue not I been much more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull for the benefites receiued of thee? If thou diddeſt pray for the Iſraelites which did kill thee once, why doeſt thou not pray for me which kill thee euery day? Doe not I put thee to death euery day and euery houre, ſeeing I doe crucifie thee as oft as I ſinne againſt thee? Seeing the ſinnes which are ſeuerally in other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are together in me, why doſt thou not ſay, Father forgiue him, as thou didſt ſay, Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?

Before the ſonne of God came into the world to take mans fleſh vpon him, God was much more accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to vſe his iuſtice then his mercie; ſeeing that in all the ſtory of the old Law, thoſe which hee chaſtiſed were very many in number, and thoſe whome hee forgaue very few.

When the eternall God had ſeene that they had put to death his welbeloued ſonne, being accuſtomed to puniſh preſently and not to pardon, he darkened the light of the ſunne, made the earth to quake, rent the vaile of the Temple, and opened the ſepulchres of the dead, becauſe thoſe which were dead ſhould riſe againe and take reuenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of thoſe which were aliue. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſon of God percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that al this was done for his ſake, &amp; that his father would deſtroy all the word for to reuenge his death, hee lifted vp his eies vnto heauen, and with a ſorrowfull voice ſaid, Father forgiue them, becauſe they know not what they doe: as if he would ſay; O my eternall and holy father, I beſeech and pray thee that thou wouldeſt forgiue this vnhappy people, ſeeing thou ſhouldeſt make more account of the bloud which I ſhed for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, than of the offence which they haue commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt thee. It is now now time for a thouſand to fall on thy left ſide, and ten thouſand on thy right: for ſeeing that I ſtand betwixt them and thee, it is not reaſon that they ſhould fall but riſe, nor that thou ſhouldeſt puniſh but pardon them. O what a happie time! O what a happy age the Catholike church liueth in, in the which hee which is iniuried is reconciled and made our friend, the iudge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our aduocate and ſpokeſman for vs, our accuſer turned
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:3666:24"/>to bee our defender, and hee who was woont to feare vs with iuſtice, doth now flatter vs and entice vs to him with mercy. How ſhal <hi>Dauid</hi> be able to ſay now, <hi>Cadent à latere eius mille,</hi> A thouſand ſhall fall on his ſide, ſeeing the ſonne of God hath ſaid vpon the croſſe, Father forgiue them? In the law of grace, and vnder the yoke of Chriſt it is not time to goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray but aright, not to caſt away our ſelues but to ſaue our ſelues, not a time of iuſtice but of mercie, not to puniſh but to pardon, neither is it time to fall but to riſe. It is much to be noted, that the ſonne of God did neuer command any man to fall and throw downe himſelfe, but rather bad all men riſe vp, as it appeareth in the ninteenth of S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> where hee ſayth, Riſe vp and take thy bed, and in another place Ariſe maid, and hee ſaid vnto him whom hee raiſed from death in Naim, <hi>adoleſcens tibi dico ſurge,</hi> and likewiſe hee ſaid in the garden to his Diſciples, Riſe let vs goe. It is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie and office of the diuell, to counſell and procure men to fall: for ſo he counſelled Chriſt in the deſart, when he ſaid, I will giue thee all theſe things, <hi>Si cadens adoraueris me,</hi> as if hee would ſay; I will make thee Lord ouer all the world, if thou wilt but fall downe on the ground. O my ſweet Ieſus I wil liue with thee, who commandeth me to riſe, and not with the diuell who counſelleth mee to fall: for hee is deſirous to haue me fall, and thou and no other art able to helpe mee vp again. Why ſhould I liue with the diuell who deceiueth me a thouſand waies, or with the world which putteth mee in a thouſand da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, or with the fleſh which asketh of me a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pleaſures? O redeemer of my ſoule, O ſweet delight of my life, I will liue and die with thee, and no other, for if I bee ſick thou doſt heale me, if I be ſorrowful thou doſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort me, if I be falling thou doſt help me, if I be falne thou doſt helpe me vp, &amp; if I haue ſinned thou doſt pardon me. He is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple of the diuell, who goeth about to throw down his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; he is the ſonne of Chriſt who doth helpe to lift vp his neighbor: for we are not able in this life to do any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a greater fauor, then to keepe his credit &amp; honor, &amp; to help him to ſaue
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:3666:24"/>his ſoule. When the giuer of life ſaid vpon the croſſe, Father forgiue them, by thoſe ſpeeches he ment to obtain two things of his father: That is, that hee would neither puniſh their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies like vnto murderers, nor condemne their ſoules like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to traitors. O infinite goodneſſe! O clemency neuer heard of before! O redeemer of my ſoule, doeſt thou diſſemble with the trecherous, pardon murderers, excuſe traitors, vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt for the credite of the infamous, &amp; turneſt vnto ſinners? It is litle when I ſay thou doeſt turn vnto ſinners, ſeeing thou doeſt not only turn vnto them but alſo die for them. What is the reaſon O good Ieſus, what is the reaſon that thou doeſt pray vnto thy father that he would forgiue them, and doeſt not ſay I doe forgiue them. When thou ſaieſt, Father pardon them, why doeſt thou not ſay alſo, I pardon them? Art thou the partie iniuried, art thou the partie ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and diſgraced, art thou the partie agreeued, and doeſt giue the libertie of pardoning them vnto another? It is a high myſterie, and a hidden Sacrament, to thinke that the ſonne of God would not ſay I pardon them, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat his father to pardon them, making greater reckoning of the iniurie which they had done vnto his father, then of the death which they procured vnto himſelfe. The reaſon why the ſonne of God would not ſay, I pardon them, although hee were the partie offended, was to tell vs plainly, That hee did not eſteeme thoſe which put him to death his enemies, rather his deer brothers &amp; great good doers vnto the world, hauing more regard vnto the good vvhich they had done in cauſing the world to be redeemed, then vnto the hurt which they did in cauſing himſelfe to bee murdered. When good Ieſus ſaid, Father forgiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſay, thou art he my good father who muſt forgiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe they haue broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy law, diſcredited thy doctrine, violated thy temple, &amp; put to death thy ſon. If thou doſt ſay that I ſhould forgiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I ſay I haue no cauſe to forgiue: for I take my death as wel reuenged, &amp; my life as well beſtowed, ſeeing that by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit thereof all the world may liue, &amp; heauen made open vnto
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:3666:25"/>all men. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> ſayth, That if the ſonne of God had holden the Iewes for his enemies, as they accounted of him, it was in his power to forſake them, and goe preach vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; but becauſe hee eſteemed of them as of his kindred in bloud, neighbours by nature, brothers by law, diſciples in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, it was not needful for him to ſay on the croſſe I forgiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſeeing he was not angry towards the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor moued at al with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They bare rancor and hatred vnto Chriſt, but nor Chriſt vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; &amp; therfore notwithſtanding all the reproches they vſed towards him, &amp; al the iniurious ſpeeches they gaue him, he neuer left off preaching vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor neuer ceaſed to work miracles amongſt them. With what face could they ſay that Chriſt was their enemy, ſeeing hee raiſed their dead, caſt out diuels fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, inſtructed their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, cured their friends of diſeaſes, &amp; alſo forgaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their ſins? Seeing the ſon of God had done the works of a friend among them, &amp; that of a true friend, why ſhould he ſay vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the croſſe, I do alſo forgiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſeeing he did not hold any one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for his enemy? If ſweet Ieſus was angry with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if he miſliked the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it was not for the iniuries which they did vnto him, but for the offences they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted againſt his father; &amp; therfore he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto him which was moſt iniuried, proteſting that himſelf was not offended with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. O ſweet Ieſus how canſt thou ſay that thou waſt not offended nor iniured by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, being as thou waſt iniuried &amp; crucified by their hands? and although thou do not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor reuenge thee on them, nor yet accuſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; yet O my redeemer why doſt thou excuſe them? <hi>Barnard</hi> ſaith, That the ſon of God was repleniſhed with ſuch great charity, and ſuch inſpeakable pity towards thoſe which crucified him, that he could not obtaine leaue of himſelfe to impute any fault vnto them, ſeeing he had charged himſelfe with the pain due for it. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, That ſeeing Chriſt was the true mediator, pacifier, &amp; ſtikler betwixt his father &amp; the world, it would haue beene euilly thought of to ſay, that any one of them were his enemies: and therevpon it is that ſeeing hee had no enemie there amongſt them, hee had no
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:3666:25"/>neceſsitie to ſay on the croſſe, I pardon them. If the ſonne of God (ſaith S. <hi>Chryſostome</hi>) hanging vpon the croſſe, ſhould haue ſaid, I alſo pardon them, it would haue beene thought that hee receiued greater griefe for the torment which hee himſelfe ſuffered, than of the iniuries which were done vnto his father; which for a certentie was not ſo: for if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, Chriſt would more willingly returne againe into the world to die, than endure to ſee one iniury done vnto his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Who dare now, O good Ieſus (ſaith S. <hi>Barnard</hi>) who dare aske a reuenge of the iniuries done vnto him, ſeeing thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt make ſuch ſmall account of thoſe which were done vnto thy ſelfe? Doeſt not thou recken of the cruell thornes which pierced thy holy head, and ſhall I make account of an angry word which my brother ſpeaketh againſt me? How ſhall I dare to ſay, that I haue enemies, ſeeing thou doeſt handle thoſe which nailed thee vnto the croſſe like brothers? It ought to be a ſtrange ſpeech in the mouth of a Chriſtian to ſay, This is my enemy; for in making thy brother thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, thou doeſt looſe Chriſt, and cauſeſt him to be no more thy friend. It is much to be noted, that Chriſt entreated not his father to pardon them after they were dead, but asked that he would pardon them quickly, yea &amp; that very quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, becauſe he would let vs vnderſtand, that the value of his precious blood was of ſuch great price, that at that inſtant that it began to be ſhedde, at the ſame time it began to doe good. The redeemer of the world would not leaue vs out of the fauor of his father, nor an enemy vnto any; in token wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hee came into the world, ſaying, <hi>Et in terra pax hominibus,</hi> Peace vnto men vpon earth: and went out of the world, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Pater ignoſce illis,</hi> Father forgiue them. The ſon of God (ſaith <hi>Caſsiodorus</hi> vpon the Pſalms) is not like vnto the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of this world, who leaue vnto their children a little wealth with much ſtrife, ſeeing that by that ſpeech of, Father forgiue them, hee redeemed vs with his blood, baptized vs with his teares, annointed vs with his ſweat, inſtructed vs with his doctrine, looſed vs from the deuill, and reconciled
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:3666:26"/>vs vnto his father. O how much are wee bound vnto thee, ſweet Ieſus, for praying vnto thy father that he would forgiue his enemies before and not after thy death, that is, before the teares of thy eies were dried vp, and whilſt the wounds of thy body were yet freſh. What would haue become of mankind if Chriſt at his death had bin angry with vs? When he ſaid in his laſt Sermon, <hi>Pacem meam do vobis,</hi> I giue you my peace, What elſe meant he, but that he left vs reconciled vnto his father, and vnited vnto himſelfe? How could the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall father (ſaith <hi>Anſelmus</hi>) deny his bleſſed ſonne the pardon which hee demaunded, ſeeing he asked it with ſuch milde wordes, with ſuch ſorrowfull teares, with ſuch freſh wounds, with ſuch louing bowels, with ſuch continual ſighes, and with ſuch great and paſsing griefe? Wee may then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that when Chriſt praied his father to pardon quickely and without delay, he teacheth vs, that before we die and go out of this life, it is conuenient for vs to pardon all iniuries; for otherwiſe thoſe in the other world ſhall haue great occaſion to weepe, which would not in this world ſpeedily forgiue.</p>

                  </gap>e choſe him for the iudge of all the words he ſpake, of all the thoughts he conceiued, of all the workes which he did, of all the enmities he ſuffered, yea and of all the friendſhips he followed. <hi>Dauid</hi> could not iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his cauſe better, than to referre the iuſtice of it vnto the hands of God, who is ſo iuſt in his perſon, ſo vpright in his iudgement, that neither praiers bow him, neither threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings feare him, nor gifts mooue him, nor words deceiue him. When good king <hi>Dauid</hi> cited <hi>Saul</hi> to appeare before the iudgement of God, <hi>Dauid</hi> could haue cut off his head if hee would, as hee did the gard of his garment: but yet hee would not doe it, becauſe hee did ſet more by Gods fauour than by <hi>Sauls</hi> euill will. <hi>Saul</hi> was a capitall enemie vnto king <hi>Dauid:</hi> hee cauſed him to flee his countrey, forſake his kindred, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued him of his riches, baniſhed him his court, ſeparated him from his wife, and proclaimed him to be his publike ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. And yet notwithſtanding all this, <hi>Dauid</hi> (if hee had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted) could haue beene reuenged of <hi>Saul,</hi> as eſpecially when hee ſtole the bottle from vnder his beds head, and cut away a piece of his garment: yet the pitifull king <hi>Dauid</hi> would not onely not do it, but ſhewed himſelfe angry with thoſe which durſt counſell him vnto it. <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith, that onely becauſe <hi>Saul</hi> was annointed king by the God of Iſrael, it ſeemed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to good king <hi>Dauid,</hi> that hee deſerued pardon, and that that was a ſufficient cauſe to make him reuerenced of all, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by none. Wee are annointed with a better oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than king <hi>Saul</hi> was: for hee was annointed with the oyle of the Oliue tree, but wee are annointed with the blood of Chriſt; and therfore he who doth perſecute a Chriſtian, doth perſecute one who is annointed by Chriſt. Good king <hi>Dauid</hi> reſpected it not that <hi>Saul</hi> did abuſe his regall vnction and annointing, but onely becauſe that hee was annointed by a good Spirit, in ſo much that <hi>Dauid</hi> regarded it not that <hi>Saul</hi> was a moſt wicked and naughtie king, but onely that God had made him a king. Thereupon Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, and that very well, that according vnto the example of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:3666:27"/>
                  <hi>Dauid,</hi> thou oughteſt not to looke vnto the malice with the which thy enemy entreateth thee, but vnto the vnction wherewith he is made a Chriſtian: and whether he be a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian or not, thou art not the iudge of this buſines, but he who is thy God and his, who is to puniſh the iniury which thou haſt done vnto him, &amp; in him the reuengement which thou haſt taken on thee. Comming then vnto our purpoſe: The words which <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpake vnto <hi>Saul,</hi> that is, Let our Lord be a iudge betwixt me and thee, the Sonne of God may ſay vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Synagogue, and vnto all her children; and that hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone ſhall bee the iudge betwixt them, as well of all the good which Chriſt did vnto the Synagogue, as of the hurt he hath receiued by her. Which of all the Angels if he would come downe vnto vs, which of the dead if hee could riſe againe, what man, were hee neuer ſo wiſe, were able to number the multitude of benefits which were ceiued by him, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible torments which they gaue him? Let our Lord bee a iudge betwixt me and thee, O Synagogue (for no other can be) how much more greater my loue was, with the which I redeemed thee, than the torments which in my paſsion thou gaueſt me, and that how thy hatred was far greater than all the cruelties thou vſedſt towards me. Therefore I call thee into iudgement, O Synagogue, before God, not to the end that he ſhould chaſtiſe thee, but onely to iudge betwixt mee &amp; thee, how that there is no worke of pity and mercy which I left vndone for thee, and how there was no cruelty of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which thou didſt not aſſay againſt mee. Speaking then more particularly of the pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which the ſonne of God gaue the Hebrewes, it were reaſon to ſhew what they did to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue it, and what mooued Chriſt to giue it; for by ſo much the more excellent &amp; bountifull is the pardon, by how much the leſſer the occaſions were to giue it. The Iewes did Chriſt fiue notorious iniuries at the time of his death, the leaſt of all which, if it had bene throughly puniſhed, had deſerued not onely not to be pardoned, but alſo condemned into eternall fire. For (ſaith <hi>Hilarius</hi>) what puniſhment worthy of their
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:3666:27"/>deſert can be giuen vnto them, who take away life from him which is the giuer of life? The firſt wrong which they did vnto Chriſt was, that they crucified him through malice, not finding any fault in him at al: which appeareth plainly by that that they did let goe <hi>Barrabas</hi> the manſlaier, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ſonne of God; iudging him to bee an honeſter man who killed thoſe which liued, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that great Prophet which raiſed vp thoſe which were dead. Chriſt was a giuer of alms, and <hi>Barrabas</hi> was a theefe; Chriſt was quiet and a peacema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and <hi>Barrabas</hi> a ſower of ſedition; Chriſt a great preacher, and <hi>Barrabas</hi> a great robber and aſſailer of men by the high way; Chriſt a maiſter of all good men, and <hi>Barrabas</hi> a captain of all ſcandalous men: and yet notwithſtanding all this they condemned Chriſt to be put immediately to death, and ſent <hi>Barrabas</hi> home vnto his houſe. O how wicked a dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d made you O yee Iews and peruerſe petition, in asking that he may liue which killeth thoſe which are aliue, and that hee ſhould die who raiſeth to life thoſe which were dead! Who is there in your citie, who can heale the ſicke and diſeaſed, or raiſe the dead vnto life, if this Prophet die? So great was the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred which they bare vnto the ſon of God, that to heare him once named they were much troubled, &amp; in <hi>Barrabas</hi> name they much reioiced; which they ſhewed manifeſtly when they cried al with one voice that <hi>Pilate</hi> ſhould deliuer them <hi>Barrabas,</hi> and crucifie Chriſt. O what a happy man ſhould I bee, if my loue towards thee were ſo great as their hatred was towards thee: for by that meanes as they tooke a wrong courſe in chuſing <hi>Barrabas</hi> for themſelues, ſo I ſhould doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in making choiſe of thee for my ſelfe. It had not ben to haue beene maruelled at if they had erred in their choiſe, if <hi>Pilat</hi> had giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their choiſe betwixt two theeues, or two mankillers, or other two ſtrangers vnto them: but giuing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the choiſe betwixt an aſſailing theefe, and a moſt holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and they preſently to chuſe the wicked one, &amp; vſe iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice againſt the good one, it could not bee but they did it through great want of wiſedome and greater abundance of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:3666:28"/>malice. The ſecond iniury was, that if they had put the ſonne of God to death in ſome mean village, it would not haue ben ſo great an infamy and reproch vnto him: but the excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated Iewes the better to reuenge themſelues vpon Chriſt and to put him to the greater ſhame, put him to death in the great city of Ieruſalem, where he was very well known by his preaching, &amp; allied vnto many honorable Perſons by conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity. What wrong like vnto this was euer done vnto any man, or what reproch comparable vnto this, that is, to lead him to bee crucified at the Mount of Caluary, through the ſame ſtreets which he was wont to paſſe through to the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to preach? <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayth, That it is a greater griefe then death it ſelfe to a man that is ſhamefaſt and of a valiant cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, to ſee himſelfe troden downe where he hath ben hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and contumeliouſly handled, where he hath been highly eſteemed: for he feeleth the preſent torment and griefe, &amp; he greeueth and perceiueth that, which his enemies ſpeake. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſon of God was mighty in doing miracles, faire and amiable in his countenance, profitable in his doctrine, and a friend vnto the weale publicke, hee was beloued of all, and enuied of many; by reaſon whereof he greeued much at the open diſhonour they did him, and that publickly they tooke his life from him. What griefe could hee be free from, ſeeing himſelfe carried openly, and condemned vnto the death of the croſſe, &amp; that his friends accompanied him weeping, and his enemies ſcorning &amp; mocking him? The third was, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they could haue put him to death ſecretly in his cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or in ſome darke night, yet they neuer ment once to do it; but they brought him forth at one of the clocke, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him at three, they crucified him at ſix, &amp; they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him at nine. It was not for want of dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but through abundance of malice that they choſe that houre, becauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſunne ſheweth his beames moſt brighteſt, &amp; moſt people paſſe through the ſtreets. <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> vpon S. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſayth, That the Iews would not put Chriſt to death in the morning becauſe all men were not vp, nor in the night becauſe all were

It was an old plague of the Synagogues to embrue &amp; fleſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in the bloud of the prophets &amp; holy men, as of <hi>Eſaias</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſawed in peeces; <hi>Ieremy</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a wel; <hi>Micheas</hi> whom they buffeted to death, <hi>Zachary</hi> whom they ſtoned to death, &amp; <hi>Ezechiel</hi> whom they impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: and becauſe the curſe of their predeceſſors ſhould reach vnto thoſe which were the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aliue, they be thought the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues to take Chriſts life fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, &amp; blemiſh his good name &amp; credite. <hi>Damaſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>geliſt ſaith, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt gaue vp the ghoſt, the ſun was dar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

S. <hi>Ciprian</hi> ſaith, That when the Iews put Chriſt to death, they were not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent only to make choice of a bright day &amp; cleare, but alſo they would haue a long day (as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly the daies are the 25 of March) becauſe they might haue time in one day to accuſe him, giue iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on him, &amp; crucifie him. The 4. point was, that although they could haue put him to death alone, yet they would not do it without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany; &amp; the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany they gaue him was not of honeſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but of two arrand theeues. It is to be weighed, that the Iews neuer gaue Chriſt the prehemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or higheſt room but only vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the croſſe and gibbet, where they crucified him betwixt two theeues, &amp; they put him in the midſt as if he had ben the greateſt theef among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al, &amp; the moſt notorious of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender. <hi>Albertus</hi> ſaith, That the Iews hanged our good Ieſus betwixt two malefactors, as if he had ben a captain &amp; a ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leader of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to make vs think therby how bad a perſon that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:3666:29"/>Prophet was, ſeeing that in compariſon of him the theeues were of a better life. Put the caſe, ſaith S. <hi>Ierom,</hi> that al the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies which they brought againſt Chriſt had been true, and that they had proued by ſufficient witneſſe thoſe crimes which they laid againſt him, yet notwithſtanding hee deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not that kind of puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, nor to be executed with ſuch infamous theeues, becauſe the Imperiall laws doe command ſuch only to be partakers of equall puniſhment which were confederates in the offence. If the ſonne of God drew ſinners vnto him &amp; receiued them, truly it was not for that he would helpe them or further them in ſinne, but to draw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to good life, in ſo much that by his bleſſed company they were not peruerted but much more conuerted. The fifth wrong was, that although they might haue put him to another kind of death, which was not ſo ſcandalous to heare of, nor ſo cruell to bee endured as the death of the croſſe, yet they would put him to no other death but that, becauſe hee ſhould end his life with great cruelty &amp; ſmart. For the torment of the croſſe was holden to be the terribleſt that was to ſuffer, &amp; the leaſt pitifull to giue, and therefore they crucified none vnleſſe it were ſuch a one as without amendment did breake the law, or ſuch a one as durſt be a traitor to the king. Was hee pardie a breaker of the law, who ſaid openly <hi>Non veni ſoluere legem ſed adimplere:</hi> I came not to breake the law, but to fulfill the law? Is he pardy a traitor who ſaid openly, <hi>Reddite quae ſunt Caeſaris Caeſari,</hi> Giue that which is <hi>Caeſars</hi> vnto <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and that which is Chriſts vnto Chriſt? They &amp; not the ſonne of God were breakers of the law, they were Traitors vnto the king, they cauſed ſedition among the people, yea they ſtole away the ſacrifices: in ſo much that againſt all order of iuſtice, thoſe tranſgreſſors murdered him which was holy, the Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors put to death him who was loiall, the guiltie crucified the innocent, and the theeues crucified their iudge. <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> ſayth, That as the hatred which they bare vnto Chriſt did paſſe al other hatred in the world, and as the enuie they bare Chriſt was far greater then any other which could ſinke into
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3666:29"/>mans heart, ſo alſo they would that the death which they gaue Chriſt, ſhould exceed the deaths which all other men did ſuffer. Who doubteth but if a worſer death they could haue inuented, a worſer death he ſhould haue had? It is to be weighed, that being an old cuſtome, that the iudges which giue ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce and not which accuſe, ſhould appoint the maner of death which the party which offendeth ſhould endure: yet the Iewes would not leaue Chriſts death vnto <hi>Pilates</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biterment, but they themſelues would preſently deſign &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point what death he ſhold die. Tel me I pray you, what death did they appoint him, or what torment did they chuſe out for him? <hi>Barrabas</hi> the theefe being louſed, &amp; let free by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent &amp; agreement of them al, <hi>Pilat</hi> asking the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what they would doe by Ieſus of Nazareth, they cried all aloud with one voice, Crucifie, crucifie him, becauſe hee is guilty of death, with few words they condemn Chriſt vnto many cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el &amp; terrible torments, that is, that he ſhould die quickly, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they ſay that he is guilty of death, that he ſhould die vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the croſſe ſeeing they ſaid crucifie him; &amp; that hee ſhould bee twiſe crucified, conſidering that they ſay crucifie, crucifie him. As touching the firſt, they entreat <hi>Pilat</hi> to put Chriſt to death, and <hi>Pilat</hi> ſaid, that he found no cauſe in him why hee ſhould die: but in fine, his reſiſtance preuailed not ſo much as their importunity. The Iews did not requeſt of <hi>Pilat</hi> that he would whip Chriſt or baniſh him, or obiect any reprochfull crime againſt him, but that he would immediatly put him to death, &amp; that becauſe the holy doctrine which he preached, and the euill life which they led were imcompatible the one with the other. And as for the ſecond, the forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iews were not content to demand of <hi>Pilat</hi> that Chriſt ſhould be put to death, and with that death which they themſelues deſired, but that they ſhould immediately crucifie him on a croſſe, which kind of puniſhment was neuer giuen but vnto very naughty &amp; wicked perſons, and for very heinous and enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſaults. S. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohn</hi> noteth, that the Iewes were not conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to cry vnto <hi>Pilat</hi> once that he would crucifie him,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3666:30"/>but they doubled their cry, &amp; ſaid crucifie him, crucifie him, to let vs vnderſtand that they meant aſwell to crucifie his fame and credite, as they did crucifie his perſon. <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith, That by entreating <hi>Pilate</hi> twiſe to crucifie him, ſaying, <hi>crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge, crucifige,</hi> was to perſuade him that hee would crucifie him with his hands, and that they would crucifie him with their hearts. They crucified him with their hearts, when with their hearts they hated and deteſted him, &amp; then they hated him with their hearts, when they diffamed his perſon, and diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited his doctrine, in ſo much that it was not without cauſe that they cried twiſe crucifie, crucifie him, ſeeing that at one time they tooke away his life, and blemiſhed his credit. And although <hi>Pilate</hi> ſhould haue been determined to put him to death, either by cutting his throat, or caſting him into a well, or by hanging him, which are eaſier deaths to ſuffer, and leſſe infamous to endure, yet the doggiſh Iews would not leaue it vnto <hi>Pilates</hi> arbitrement and free will, for feare leaſt he wold haue beene too pitifull in the maner of his death. When cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine words are doubled in holy ſcripture, it is a great ſigne of loue or hatred in thoſe which vſe them, as when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Deſiderio deſideraui,</hi> I haue deſired with deſire, and when he ſaid <hi>Martha, Martha,</hi> in which words he ſhewed the loue and affection which hee bare vnto his diſciples, and what tender loue he bare to <hi>Martha,</hi> who gueſted him in her houſe. The Iews alſo by iterating of thoſe words, ſhewed the great hatred which they bare vnto Chriſt, and let vs vnderſtand with what heart &amp; good wil they crucified him. Behold the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their deeds towards Chriſt, &amp; behold alſo the deſerts which were found to be in them. Yet notwithſtanding all this, in recompence of the cruel death which they gaue him, &amp; the great ſhame and infamy they put him to, he ſaith with a loud voice, Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue them, for they know not what they doe.</p>

And they are as if he ſhould ſay; O wicked and infortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate people of the Iews, which art come vnto that boldneſſe of ſinning, that like vnto a publick whore, thou haſt no ſhame in doing naught. Turne therefore vnto me O ſinfull Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, turn thy ſelfe vnto me thou vnfortunate Synagogue; for I can doe no leſſe when thou doeſt aske any thing of me like as of a father, but I muſt graunt it vnto thee like a ſonne. S. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi> vpon theſe words ſaith. O what an infinit goodneſſe and mercy is this, O my God and Lord, that ſeeing thou haſt tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted &amp; condemned Ieruſalem as one which was full of ſinne, and without ſhame, yea and haſt compared her vnto a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke ſtrumpet, yet thou doeſt entreat her to amend, &amp; giueſt her licenſe to call thee Father. Whome wilt thou caſt from thee, and denie to be thy ſon, ſeeing thou doeſt vouchſafe to be a father vnto a ſtrumpet? If thou doſt admit publick lewd wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into thy company, is it like that thou wilt caſt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee the honeſt and vertuous ones of thy houſe? If thou loue thoſe which are ſinfull and ſhameleſſe, who is a greater ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or leſſe baſhful, or more lewd then this my wicked ſoule? If the remedy of my ſoule conſiſt in nothing elſe but in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thee Father, from this time forward I do cal thee Father; and if thou doſt require nothing elſe of me, but that I ſhould turne vnto thee, O good Ieſus I turne vnto thee, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:3666:31"/>aske thee forgiueneſſe of all my ſinnes, and ſeeing I doe turne vnto thee as vnto my Lord, and confeſſe my ſelfe before thee to bee a great ſinner, I beſeech thee moſt humbly, that thou wouldſt not caſt me from before thy face, &amp; that thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt not take thy holy ſpirit from me: for if thy holy grace for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake me, my ſoule is turned vnto that that ſhe was before, that is vnto a ſhameleſſe and lewd woman. It is much to be noted here, that God doth not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine of the Iews that they were enuious, angry, or gluttennous, but that they were bold and without ſhame; which wanteth not a high myſtery, becauſe there is no greater ſigne in all the world that a mans conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is very corrupt, then when to ſin he hath no ſhame at al. I haue a great hope (ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) that that ſinner will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend his life which ſinneth ſecretly, and is aſhamed of it; which hope I haue not of him, who is reſolute in his ſpeech, and diſſolute in ſinne, becauſe that that man doth either very late or neuer amend his manners, who by long vſe hath har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened his conſcience. To come then vnto our purpoſe, with very great reaſon and for iuſt occaſion God called the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue a ſhameleſſe and diſſolute ſtrumpet, ſeeing that in the death of his ſonne ſhee ſhewed not onely her malice, but alſo her impudency, in killing him in the open day, not being ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull for it at all. Chriſt knew very well that which his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had promiſed vnto the Iewes, that is, that if they would call him Father, hee would forgiue them as his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. By reaſon whereof Chriſt our God began his praier with Father forgiue them, giuing thereby to vnderſtand, that ſeeing hee called him Father, hee ſhould bee heard like a ſonne. If it ſeeme vnto you my louing brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (ſaith S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi>) that the Iews had no occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to put Chriſt their Lord to death, neither did he ſee in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any condition whereby he ſhould pardon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: and touching this mercifull pardon I can tell you, that I doe not ſo much maruell of the pardon which hee giueth on the croſſe, as I doe of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances with the which hee dooth giue it. The Iewes ſhewed their naughtineſſe towards Chriſt in many thinges,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:3666:31"/>but the ſon of God ſhewed his mercy &amp; clemency towards the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in many more things: for there is no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this life able to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit ſo great an offence, but Gods mercy can go beyond it. The firſt thing wherin he ſhewed his mercy towards the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, was in the petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which he made vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the croſſe for them, that is, pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; remiſsion of their ſins being his enemies; preferring them before his bleſſed mother, which brought him into the world, &amp; his welbeloued diſciple which followed him, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> whom he ſo much loued. What charity (ſaith <hi>Remigius</hi>) ſhold haue burned in his diuine bowels, who at the very inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his own death, reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>breth firſt to releeue his enemies, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort his friends? what meaneth this O good Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, what meaneth this; doeſt thou firſt reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber thoſe who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly blaſpheme thee, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe which ſtand at the foot of the croſſe weeping for thee? O infinit charity! O inſpeakable good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, what hart could do that which thou doſt. S. <hi>Barnard</hi> ſaith, that it was in maner of a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tention whether were greater the ſighs of the faithful, the tears which iſſued out of his mothers eies, or the bloud which guſhed out of Chriſt vains, or the blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies which the wicked Iewes vttered with their mouth: but yet our holy &amp; meek Ieſus did firſt pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the iniuries, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was mindful of the tears.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:3666:32"/>greater vnto him, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſee his mothers eies run downe with tears. Let no man the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wonder, nor maruel that our good Ieſus did reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber himſelf firſt of the people which murdered him before his mother which bare him, becauſe he came not into the world to drie me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s eies fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> weeping, but to ſaueſoules from periſhing. Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, the ſon of God ſhewed his mercy in asking pardon for his enemies with kind &amp; ſweet words: that is, not by calling him God, or Lord, or creator, but only father, which is a word anſwerable vnto mercy &amp; pity, &amp; contrariwiſe this word God, or Lord, doth alwaies ſignifie iuſtice. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt ſaid, Father forgiue them, hee would haue ſaid, Lord forgiue them, or my God forgiue them, it would haue ſeemed that he would haue had the pardon according vnto the rigor of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: the which if he had required or his father granted, there is no doubt at al, but before the ſon of God ſhould haue yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vp his ghoſt, the ground would haue opened &amp; ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſon of God would ask any great thing of his father, he began his praier alwaies with Father; as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaid, I confeſſe vnto thee O father, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaid Father into thy hands I co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend my ſpirit. What meaneth this O redec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of my ſoule, what meaneth this? Is thy pity ſo great to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs, and thy mercy ſo abundant, that thou doeſt pray for thy enemies with the ſame wordes, as thou doeſt pray for thy own affairs?

                  <hi>Iohn</hi> pardoned his reproch and perill, <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> her anguiſh and diſtreſſe, and the good theefe was pardoned of his ſinne. How was it poſsible that the Father ſhould not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue the world of their ſinnes, ſeeing that on one day in one houre, and at one time they ſaid, Father forgiue them; the ſon by letting his bloud ſtreame from his vaines, the mother by ſuffering her tears flow from her eies, and the ſadde familie by piercing the heauen with their ſighes? Becauſe (ſaith <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi>) the office of the ſon of God was, to put together that which was broken, and reconcile thoſe which diſagreed, hee would not depart out of this world, before hee had made an attonement betwixt his friendes and his foes, beſeeching his father to forgiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manding his mother not to accuſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

But what iuſtice could ſhe ask of thoſe male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors, ſeeing they had been already pardoned of her ſonne? <hi>Anſelmus</hi> ſaith, That whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Ieſus gaue vp the ghoſt vpon the croſſe, he left no death for his mother to reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, nor iniury to forgiue, but only a bitter paſsion to weep and bewaile, which ſhold be great inough to rend her bowels in ſunder, &amp; dry vp the tears of hir eies. The 4. goodnes which Chriſt ſhewed the Iews, was in that he gaue pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to his enemies which did not dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it, &amp; yeelded that vnto his crucifiers which they wold not haue.

And how ſhould they acknowledge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues culpable which caſt al the fault vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him which deſerued it not? The Iews were ſo fleſhed in the bloud of Chriſt, &amp; ſo far out of their wits, that they did not not only procure &amp; ask pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, but rather hindered it &amp; put it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when it was offered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king delight in the hurt which they did vnto Chriſt, &amp; griefe
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:3666:33"/>that they were not able to do him more. When they led the innocent lambe to be crucified, for very ioy they ſaid, O thou which doeſt deſtroy the Temple of God. And when <hi>Pilat</hi> would haue deferred his crucifying, with great enuy they ſaid, If thou let this man goe, thou art not a friend vnto <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar:</hi> in ſo much that if they did ſhew themſelues grieued and ſorrie, it was not for that they thought themſelues culpable of any crime, but becauſe they had deferred and prolonged Chriſts life ſo long time. The wickedneſſe of the Iewes was not content in not hauing pardon of God for their offences, but they demaunded openly vengeance for them, when they ſaid vnto <hi>Pilat,</hi> Let his blood fall vpon vs and vpon our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and therefore by theſe dreadfull words they deſire to be puniſhed of God, and at no time pardoned at his hands.

The ſonne of God appealeth from theſe words which they ſpeake, and he will not ſtand vnto that agreement which the Iewes made with <hi>Pilat;</hi> hee will not agree that his blood ſhould be ſhed againſt them, but for them: and therefore as they ſaid, Let his blood fall vpon vs; ſo contrariwiſe he ſaid, Father forgiue them. O wicked Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, O vnfortunate Iewiſh nation (ſaith <hi>Remigius</hi>) who hath led you vnto ſuch great folly and madneſſe, that you ſhould more eſteeme of the blood of kine (which your prieſts ſhed in the Temple) than of the blood which Chriſt ſhed in the mount of Caluarie? Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith, On the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of the croſſe the Prophecie of <hi>Simeon</hi> was fulfilled, who ſaid, that Chriſts comming into the world was to ſome mens good and to others hurt, ſeeing that wee doe pray that the blood which hee ſheddeth ſhould be in the remiſsion of our ſinnes, and the Iewes doe intreat that it turne vnto their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, and vpon their children. It is much to be noted, that wee ſee it often times fall out, that one enemy hurteth not another, and that a good Chriſtian doth pardon another
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:3666:34"/>of his offence when hee repenteth, wee ſee it alſo by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; likewiſe we ſee it fulfilled that a perfit man doth loue his enemy: but yet wee neuer ſaw that euer any but Chriſt pardoned him which would not be pardoned. And how would they be pardoned who pardoned <hi>Barrabas</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the ſonne of God? What contrition of their ſinnes haue they, who deſired of <hi>Pilat</hi> that the curſe of God ſhould light vpon them and vpon their children? O infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe! O vnſpeakable charity! did they ſay pardy with king <hi>Dauid, Tibi ſoli peccaui,</hi> To thee alone haue I ſinned: or with the thiefe, <hi>Domine memento mei,</hi> Lord remember me; to the end that he ſhould ſay, God be mercifull vnto you, <hi>Miſerea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur veſtri?</hi> What wit is able to conceiue, or what heart able to acknowledge ſuch great mercy, when thou ſaidſt, Forgiue them, in ſtead of their <hi>ſanguis eius,</hi> His blood light vpon vs? O my good Ieſus, O my ſoules health, who is hee who dare ſay, that hee hath enemies now, ſeeing that thou doeſt make cleane the vncleane, ſetteſt thoſe at libertie which will not be free, looſeſt thoſe which wil be bound, vnburdeneſt thoſe which will bee burdened, and aboue all giueſt pardon vnto thoſe which will not be pardoned? If thou doeſt pardon that people which would not be pardoned, wilt thou not with a better will pardon him who hath repented him of his ſinnes, and whome it grieueth with all his heart to haue offended thee? Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, Will not he who meant to meete them who came to apprehend him in the garden of <hi>Gethſemani,</hi> come out to receiue and embrace thoſe who goe to ſerue him?

This is a wonderfull figure &amp; worthy of great attention and conſideration, ſeeing that our Lord doeth teach vs by it, the great good turnes which hee doth vnto vs, and that which in recompence thereof wee are to doe vnto him againe. Who is that king <hi>Iehu</hi> who taketh his iourney from Iudea vnto Samaria to kill and to take ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance vpon the wicked men which were there, but onely the ſonne of God, who came downe from heauen aboue to deſtroy our ſinnes? Aſſure mee (ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) that there be no ſinners in the world, and I will aſſure thee that there be no naughty men in the world; for as in heauen there is no ſinne remitted, nor any wicked man there ſuffered, and as contrariwiſe there is nothing but ſinne and wickedneſſe in hell, ſo alſo there is nothing but naughty and wicked men. Wee are much more bound vnto our Chriſt, than Samaria
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:3666:35"/>vnto their king Iehu, becauſe that that king did only rid Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria of naughty men, but the ſonne of God made cleane &amp; purged all the earth from ſinne. Who are the children of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chab</hi> whoſe heads king <hi>Iehu</hi> cut off, and who are the prieſts of <hi>Baal</hi> which the alſo ſlew, but Idolatry which hee tooke away from the Gentiles, and the Moſaicall law which hee tooke from the Iewes? What is the charriot which the ſon of God went vp into to accompliſh ſuch high and ſtrange things, but onely the croſſe vpon the which our holy Lord attained ſuch and ſo many great victories? It is to be noted that the king <hi>Iehu</hi> did not aske <hi>Ionadab</hi> whether their apparell were alike or neat of one faſhion, but if they loued one another alike; to let vs vnderſtand, that without compariſon our Lord doeth much more regard the loue which wee beare him, than the ſeruices which wee doe him. Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> vpon the Prophet which ſaith, <hi>Bonorum meorum non eges,</hi> Thou wanteſt not of my goods, ſaith, I ſee wel, my God, I ſee well, that how much the more need I haue of thee, the leſſe thou haſt of me; and if thou haſt need of mee, it is not in reſpect of the goods of fortune, but the loue of my mind. Note alſo that the king of Iſrael and no other tooke <hi>Ionadab</hi> by the hand to lift him vp into the charriot; whereby we are to vnderſtand, that onely the ſonne of God &amp; no other Saint of heauen, is able to giue vs grace to loue him, &amp; giue vs ſtrength to follow him. Who is able to follow thee, or hath power to imitate thee, O re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of the vvorld, if thou doe not firſt ſtretch out thy hand vnto him? who is able to lift himſelfe vp vnto the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot where thou doeſt triumph, or vnto the croſſe whither thou goeſt to die, if thou doe not take vs by the arme to lift vs vp, and if thou doe not hold vs by the hand leaſt wee fall? How had it beene poſsible for <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> to haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken her prophane life, or <hi>Matthew</hi> his renting of cuſtome, or <hi>Paul</hi> his perſecution, or the thiefe his aſſailing of men by the high vvay, if the ſonne of God had not taken them by the hand, and lifted them vp vnto the croſſe with him?

And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the king of Iſrael was not content to ask <hi>Ionadabs</hi> heart, but that hee ſhould giue it him vpright, ſincere and entire; which Chriſt alſo demandeth of vs, becauſe the ſon of God will neuer take him for his friend, who hath his heart croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, ſiniſter, and not vpright. And who hath his heart vpright and ſincere, but the ſeruant of our Lord, and hee which hath no other thing in this world, nor ſeeketh after any thing but onely Ieſus Chriſt? Who is hee who hath his heart crooked and awry, but hee who is without life, who hath care neither of Chriſt, neither of himſelfe, but goeth euery houre more
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:3666:36"/>and more ſinking, and as it were drowned in the world? <hi>Dauid</hi> knew this very wel, when he ſaid, <hi>Cor mundum crea in me deus, &amp; ſpiritum rectum innoua in viſceribus meis,</hi> as if he would ſay; O great God of Iſrael, O great Lord of the houſe of <hi>Iacob,</hi> I beſeech thee that thou wouldeſt create a new heart in mee, and fauor me with the gift of a new ſpirit which may be both right and true: for the heart which I brought from the womb of my mother, is ſuch a one, as I dare not offer it vnto thee, nor he dareth not appear in thy preſence, becauſe it is vnclean with ſinne, and loaden with thoughts and care. O good Ieſus, O my ſoules hope, what better praier can I make vnto thee, or what iuſter petition can I make vnto thee, then that thou wouldeſt create a new heart in mee. That is, that you woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt giue mee a cleane heart, with the which I may praiſe thee, and a new ſpirit with the which I may loue thee. Giue me O good Lord, giue me a new ſpirit, becauſe mine is old &amp; vnpleaſant vnto thee, giue me a cleane and a chaſt heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe mine is foule and ſtinking before thy face: for if thou do not, no praier of mine can bee acceptable vnto thee, nor no worke that I doe can bee meritorious vnto thee. <hi>Caſsiodorus</hi> noteth, That king <hi>Dauid</hi> was not content that hee was noble in bloud, a Prophet by office, a king in degree, and in ſurname and calling of a roiall tribe, but he asketh of God aboue all things, that hee would giue him a cleane heart, and poure the holy ghoſt into him; to let vs vnderſtand that it doth little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile vs to bee gratefull vnto the world, if withall wee bee hatefull vnto God. Then wee are hatefull vnto God and out of his ſauour, vvhen our hearts bee vncleane and loaden with many ſpirits, and then wee haue many ſpirits, when vvee pleaſe others better then wee pleaſe God. Which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet liketh not, but praieth vnto God that it would pleaſe him to giue him a cleane heart to beleeue in him, and an vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right to ſerue him. Why vvouldeſt thou O my ſoule haue more then one heart, ſeeing thou art to loue but one Chriſt onely? And vvhy alſo vvouldeſt thou haue more then one holy ſpirit, conſidering that it is the Deuill vvhich poureth
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:3666:36"/>many ſpirits into one body, and our God for all bodies hath but one onely ſpirit? S. <hi>Barnard</hi> vpon the paſsion of our Lord ſayth; If wee vvill aſcend with Chriſt to the croſſe, it is neceſſary for vs to doe that with our hearts that hee did with his; that is, with the heart of God hee tooke the heart of a man, and with the heart of a ſpirit hee tooke a heart of fleſh, and with a high heart hee tooke a low heart, and vvith a heart of reuenge hee tooke a heart of pitie and mercy. Take good Lord a new heart to come downe from heauen into the world, and doe not renue thy heart to aſcend from the world to heauen.</p>

And it is eaſily perceiued that there is nothing, <hi>Ex omni parte beatum,</hi> becauſe there hath neuer been any Prince in the world ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and renowned, no Philoſopher ſo wiſe, no captaine ſo valorous, no perſonage ſo worthy who wanted not ſomewhat worthy of commendation, and in whom there was not found ſomwhat worthy of reprehenſion.

How can wee ſay that there is any man happy on earth, ſeeing he doth a thouſand things whereof hee hath cauſe to repent, &amp; ſcarſe one thing worthy of praiſe? Only our Lord and no other is, <hi>ex omni parte beatuis,</hi> in all reſpects happy ſeeing that of him and of no other, the Prophet ſaith, <hi>lustus es domine &amp; rectum iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium tuum,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay; Our Lord is very iuſt in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and vpright in all which hee dooth.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:3666:38"/>iuſt, becauſe there are many which are iuſt, and yet doe no iuſtice; and very many which doe iuſtice, and yet are not iuſt. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, That it is ſo high and heroical a vertue to hit aright in all things, and not to be able to miſſe in any, that God reſerued this point onely vnto himſelfe, and participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it with none but vnto his ſonne and vnto his mother. <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> vpon the Pſalmes ſayth. That it is a ſmall matter to ſay of our Lord that he is iuſt, ſeeing hee is iuſtice it ſelfe, and to ſay that he is vpright, ſeeing that he is righteouſneſſe it ſelfe, and to ſay that hee is holy, ſeeing that he is holineſſe it ſelfe: becauſe there is no other righteouſneſſe but that which hee hath, no holineſſe but that which hee giueth, nor iuſtice but that which he doth. Who is ſo blind who ſeeth not plainely that our Lord is iuſt and his iudgement right, ſeeing there is no other goodneſſe but that which is himſelfe, nor other iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice but that which hee dooth in his owne houſe? Who is ſo iuſt as thou (ſayth <hi>Hierome</hi>) in that which thou doeſt, and ſo vpright in that which he iudgeth as thou art, O great God of Iſraell; ſeeing that in thy iudgements and ſentences nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorance deceiueth thee, nor entreaty boweth thee, nor rewards corrupt thee, nor threatnings feare thee? To come then vnto our purpoſe, ſeeing that thou art iuſt O good Lord, and that thy iudgement is rightfull, how fell it out that thou diddeſt ſend <hi>Iudas</hi> from the croſſe into hel, and tookeſt the theefe from thence with thee to Paradiſe? Theefe for theefe, naught for naught, ſinner for ſinner, vngratefull for vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull, and both alike: it ſeemeth vnto mans iudgement that he ſhould as well haue beſtowed his kingdome vpon <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> which followed him three years, as vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the theefe which accompanied him three houres.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:3666:38"/>it. If Chriſt ſhould take a kingdome from a naughty man and beſtow it vpon a good man, it would bee but iuſt: but yet it would ſcome a hard point to take it from one theefe &amp; giue it to another, becauſe that that is very ill beſtowed which is giuen vnto one which is vnworthy of it. Was not the one as great a theefe as the other, ſeeing that when the one went robbing by the high way, the other being with Chriſt ſtole away the almes? But wee anſwere vnto this and ſay, that neither in this nor in any other God is to be called in queſtion, nor yet holy Ieſus to bee reprehended, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that iuſtly he ſent the Traitor <hi>Iudas</hi> into hell, and iuſtly likewiſe he carried the theefe with him to Paradiſe; becauſe the one did deſerue it becauſe hee was a confeſſor, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loſt it becauſe hee was a Traitor. Let vs not bee proud or ſtout (ſayth <hi>Cyrillus</hi>) for any thing that God dooth, nor bee moued at any thing that God prouideth: for we iudge a man only by the apparrell which he weareth, but he iudgeth him not but by the merites which he doth. <hi>Damaſcen</hi> ſayth, That before the high Tribunall ſeat of Chriſt, they doe iniury vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to no man, they deny no man iuſtice, they are moued with no man, neither do they any thing there without reaſon, becauſe there the rod of iuſtice is neuer bowed, nor the meaſure of mercy euer falſified.

Wee read in the Prophet <hi>Daniell,</hi> that when God tooke away the kingdome from king <hi>Baltaſer,</hi> that firſt hee reckoned and compared his demerites with the merites of the Chaldeans, by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring thoſe of the one, and weighing thoſe of the other; and in the end hee found by iuſtice, that the Chaldeans deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to raigne, and <hi>Baltaſer</hi> worthie to loſe his life and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate. Seeing there is alwaies (ſayth <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi>) in the houſe of God weight and meaſure, <hi>Quia omnia feciſti in pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere &amp; menſura,</hi> how is it poſsible that it ſhould be euilly go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned?

Vnder a few briefe wordes, the Scripture accuſeth <hi>Iudas</hi> of very enormious and greeuous faultes, conſidering that it calleth him an open theefe, and ſaith, that he had little purſes where he kept that which hee had ſtolne, and that he had no compaſsion or pity vpon any. It is a careleſneſſe for a man to be naught alone, to bee naught in the company of naughty men is weakeneſſe, but to be naught in the company of good men is malice and wickedneſſe; becauſe it is better reaſon that one follow many,

How ſhould it bee poſsible for him to bee good in the company of the deuill, which was naught in the company of Chriſt? If the infamous <hi>Iudas</hi> was a theefe and a Traitor, couetous and ambitious, liuing in the company of ſo many good, what doeſt thou then hope for brother (ſayth <hi>Cyprian</hi>) vvhich art compaſſed on euery ſide with ſo many naughty men? <hi>Irenaus</hi> ſayth, That <hi>Iudas</hi> began to play the Apoſtatae immeadiately after that hee entered into the Apoſtleſhip, and that Chriſts goodneſſe did much ſhine vpon him in looking ſo long for his amendment, which <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> neuer did, nor neuer forſooke his theeuing. The firſt thing that the Scripture accuſeth <hi>Iudas</hi> of, was, that hee was a murmurer and a detractor: ſaying, <hi>Vt quid perditio haec, &amp;c.</hi> as if hee would ſay, If it bee ſo that Chriſt my maiſter hath made profeſsion of a vertuous man, and preacheth pouerty vnto all the world, and alſo reprehendeth ſharpely all ſuch as ſpend any thing waſtfully; it would bee better for him (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he might conforme his life vnto his doctrine, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand this ointment to bee ſold for a great deale of money, and diuide it afterward among the poore and needy. Here <hi>Iudas</hi> doth murmure notoriouſly, ſeeing hee murmureth at the ointment which was ſhed, and how euilly it was beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and at <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> which ſhed it, and hee murmureth at Chriſt vpon whome it was caſt. When excommunicated <hi>Iudas</hi> ſaid, <hi>Ad quid perditio haec,</hi> hee iniuried the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, which would not murmure as hee did, hee ſcandalized

                  <hi>Simon</hi> the leaper, in hearing ſuch thinges ſpoken of his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, hee iniuried <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> in finding fault with her for ſpending of the ointment, and hee rebuked Chriſt, and noted him to be a curious and a daintie man in ſuffering it to be ſpent vpon himſelfe. <hi>Anſelmus</hi> talking vnto <hi>Iudas</hi> ſayth, Tell mee I pray thee <hi>Iudas,</hi> if the ſhedding of the ointment vpon thy maiſter was a good worke, why doeſt thou not like of it as the reſt of the Apoſtles doe? If pardy it were done ſcandalouſly, was not S. <hi>Peter</hi> there to haue reprehended it, who was thy ancient, and was not S. <hi>Iohn</hi> there alſo to haue hindered it, and counſelled him, who was more familiar with him than thou waſt? O wicked <hi>Iudas</hi> what iuſtice is it to ſell thy maiſter for money, and yet to hold it for an euill thing to annoint him with ointments? Doeſt thou make a conſcience of it, that they ſhould annoint Chriſt his tender fleſh, and doeſt thou make it no ſcruple at all to ſteale away the almes? O bleſſed <hi>Magdalen,</hi> O happy woman! O happy had he ben which had ben worthy to haue ben there at that hour when thou diddeſt annoint thy maiſter and my God, and happy had I beene when thou diddeſt annoint him with holy oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if I could haue tempered and mixed it with my tears, and as thou diddeſt annoint him with an ointment, I could haue waſhed him with my tears. I do not ſo much meruell at the malice of <hi>Iudas,</hi> as I doe at the patience of <hi>Magdalen,</hi> for not regarding what <hi>Iudas</hi> did, the more hee murmured, the more haſt ſhee made in annointing him. O what a number of murmurers there be now adaies (ſaith S. <hi>Ierome</hi> in an epiſtle) which ſay with <hi>Iudas, Vt quid perditio haec,</hi> What needeth this loſſe, condemning &amp; finding fault at all that which is not done according vnto their will and pleaſure, in ſo much that the murmurer thinketh nothing well done vnleſſe it be done as hee will. <hi>Hilarius</hi> ſaith, Many murmurers doe murmure at the ſumptuoſity of churches, and at the riches of holy pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſaying with <hi>Iudas, Vt quid perditio haec,</hi> all which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they murmure, it is not ſo much becauſe they ſee it in the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but becauſe they haue it not in their owne houſes.

Why doſt thou murmure, O thou mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murer, if thou doeſt ſee thy brother eaſe his body of continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all paine and trauell, and recreate ſomewhat and refreſh his bones, ſeeing thereby thou art not preiudiced at al? he which iudgeth in euill part of the recreation which his neighbor ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, murmureth at Chriſt with <hi>Iudas,</hi> ſeeing that the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of great perſonages doth not ſo much conſiſt in hauing their bodies broken, as it doth in hauing their hearts pure and cleane. Put the caſe (ſaith S. <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi>) That there were a fault in that vnction, yet without compariſon <hi>Iudas</hi> did far more ſinne in murmuring at it, then <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> in doing it, or Chriſt in conſenting vnto it. Let no man iudge his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor (ſaith <hi>Barnard</hi>) Let no man find fault at another mans do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe that murmuring is ſo odious in Gods ſight, that oftentime hee which murmureth at anothers doing, ſinneth more then he which doth the thing. The ſecond accuſation in ſcripture againſt this traitor <hi>Iudas</hi> was, that he was a noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous theefe; which was a vice by God in the old law ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbidden, and with greeuous puniſhments chaſtiſed. <hi>Ea quae mittebantur portabat Iudas,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> chap. 12. As if he would ſay: The office which <hi>Iudas Iſcarioth</hi> had in Chriſts houſe was to receiue and take charge ouer all the alms which denout perſons did ſend vnto Chriſt, and to beſtow them, and deuide them to Chriſts vſe and his Apoſtles. S. <hi>Iohns</hi> woords are to be noted, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaith, That <hi>Iudas</hi> caried thoſe things which were ſent them: wherein he noteth the great perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, and of his Colledge, conſidering that he asked nothing from dore to dore, but did eat only of the alms which were ſent them vnto their houſe. The ſon of God (ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſceu</hi>) nor thoſe of his holy colledge, were not of thoſe poor which were troubleſome and importunate, becauſe he buſied
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:3666:41"/>himſelfe more in preaching than in begging: for if they had no almes ſent vnto them, they did eate the eares of the come and the hearbs of the fields. We do not read in the courſe of the whole Goſpell, that Chriſt commanded or commended any other matter vnto <hi>Iudas</hi> his diſciple, but the gathering of the almes and the charge of thoſe temporall matters; in ſo much that were it much or little which they did ſend vnto Chriſt, <hi>Iudas</hi> did both receiue it and deuide it, and withall ſteale the beſt part of it. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith thus, If wee marke it well, our Lord commended his holy ſoule vnto his Father, his bleſſed mother vnto Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> his holy Church vnto Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> his glorious body to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and his poore ſubſtance and wealth vnto <hi>Iudas;</hi> in ſo much that hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the goods of this life vnto the wickedeſt man that was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aliue. It is not to be thought that it is a good ſign if our Lord giue any great aboundance of temporall wealth in this world, ſeeing that naughty <hi>Iudas <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>charioth</hi> had more wealth lone than Chriſts whole company and colledge all togither. It is much to be noted, that ſeeing Chriſt had neither houſe, nor vineyard, nor land, not other rent, but onely the almes which they gaue him in the commonwealth: &amp; alſo it is to be thought religiouſly, that that which <hi>Iudas</hi> ſtole from Chriſt could not bee much, nor that which hee detained from the almes which was giuen him. If it be ſo then, that Chriſt had but little, and that that which <hi>Iudas</hi> ſtole was not much, why doth the ſcripture with open mouth call him a theefe? wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked <hi>

                     </gap>udas</hi> was a thiefe and that a great thiefe, becauſe that that which he ſtole was a holy thing, and a holy almes, and in a holy houſe, and did belong vnto a holy perſon; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore according vnto the law of God, that cannot be a ſmall theft which is done in a holy and ſacred place. Saint <hi>Auguſt.</hi> ſaith, that as the two mites which the poore old woman offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Temple were more acceptable vnto God than all the treaſures of the people, ſo our Lord is more offended with a little which is taken out of the Temple, than with a great deale ſtollen in the world. <hi>Benauenture</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Iudas</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:3666:42"/>did not condemne himſelfe for the great quantitie which he ſtole, but becauſe it was a holy place from whence hee ſtole it, and therevpon it is, my religious brother, that thou maieſt offend more in taking a ſmall thing out of thy monaſtery, then a ſecular man in taking a greater out of the market. Why ſhould any man meruell, that the Scripture calleth vnhappie <hi>Iudas</hi> a theefe, ſeeing hee ſtole away the life and goods from the king of glory? <hi>Iudas</hi> ſold Chriſts life for many, he put Chriſts fame and credit to pledge with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and hee put Chriſts wealth into his purſes: in ſo much that if Chriſt more had had, more this theefe would haue robbed. O good Ieſus, O redeemer of my ſoule, if I were <hi>Iudas,</hi> or <hi>Iudas</hi> were as I am, I would neuer haue pledged thy honour and credit, nor haue ſold thy life: that which I would haue ſtolne ſhould haue beene the humilitie the which thou diddeſt liue with, the patience which thou diddeſt ſpeake with, and the charitie which thou didſt forgiue with, and the zeale which thou diddeſt preach with. O what a happy theefe ſhould I be if I could rob all theſe vertues from thee, ſeeing that in ſtead of theſe thefts heauen gates would be open vnto me. The third accuſation is, that wicked <hi>Iudas Habebat loculos,</hi> that is, had a purſe with litle purſes in it to hide the pence which he had ſtolne. Rich couetous men are wont to put their double duckats in one purſe, the ſingle in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhillings in another, and their ſmall money in another, becauſe they may find them quickly, and count them eaſily. Wherein ſaith <hi>Seneca</hi> doth the felicity of couetous men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, but in ſeeing euery houre their purſe, counting their money, alwaies hoording vp ſomewhat, and in ſtudieng how they may leſſen their ordinary charges? <hi>Aymon</hi> noteth, That the Scripture ſayth not, that <hi>Iudas</hi> had purſes, but little purſes, whereby is gathered Chriſts and his colledges great pouertie, ſeeing that all which that theefe ſtole was but ſmall baſe money which might well bee contained in ſmall purſes. Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> noteth, That there was ſo little money in Chriſts family, that there was not enough to ſtuffe a
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:3666:42"/>little purſe, much leſſe many purſes: and when the Scripture ſayth, that <hi>Iudas</hi> had many purſes, it was becauſe hee had one common purſe to ſpend of, and another ſecretly to ſteale with. O happy time, O golden age of the primitiue Church in the which there was but one purſe among them all: but now alaſſe that not among worldlings, but alſo among them which profeſſe a monaſticall life, there is ſcarſe any one which hath not with <hi>Iudas</hi> his ſmall purſes to keepe his own money in. And hee ſaith further, tell me traiterous Monke, tell mee thou Monke which haſt propertie in thinges, what difference is betwixt thee which ſtealeſt the reuenues of thy Monaſtery, and the Traitor <hi>Iudas</hi> which ſtole the almes from Chriſt? <hi>Anſelmus</hi> ſayth, That as all perfect men are more bound vnto ſtraight vſes, than all other worldlings, I dare affirme that hee hath ſecret purſes hidden with <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> which in his cell foſtereth diſordinate and ſuperfluous appetites. Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> in his Rule ſayth, As it is a greater perfection in a religious perſon to want his owne will, than to want any kind of money, yet wee may ſay of ſuch a one that it is more daungerous for him to bee mutinous againſt his ſuperiour, then to haue his purſe full of money. Now thou art to vnderſtand my religious brother, that <hi>Iudas</hi> did not ſo much damne himſelfe for the money which he carried, as he did becauſe he did what he luſted. It is an euill thing to beare the purſe, but it is farre worſe to bee wedded vnto a mans owne will: it is a bad thing to carry purſes with money, but far worſe to fulfill a mans owne appetites, becauſe there is no ſin which burneth ſo much in hell as the ſin of a mans owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per will.</p>

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:3666:43"/>but he did not forſake them, <hi>Vſquequaque,</hi> that is, vntil death; for of great ſinners they became very holy and choſen men.

The ſcripture accuſeth <hi>Iudas</hi> that he had noregard vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the needy and poore, but that he was more careful to ſteal ſomewhat from the almes which was giuen vnto Chriſt, then to bee pitifull vpon the poore and neceſsities which were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the people. <hi>Suſpirabam, ligatus ſum non cathenis ferreis, ſed me a praua voluntate,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in the eighth of his Confeſsions, as if he would ſay; O how many times did I pierce the heauens with ſighes, and watered the fields with my teares, ſeeing my ſelfe taken and bound in yrons, and yet not with fetters and cheines, but with my own proper wicked vvill: and that vvhich I cannot ſpeake vvithout vveping is, that I yeelded my owne will vnto the enemie, and with my vvill he doth that vvhich is not my will.

What would the Prophet ſay when hee ſaith, <hi>abyſſus abiſſum inuocat,</hi> One depth calleth another, but that the qualitie of one ſinne is to call another vnto him. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> vpon the Pſalmes ſaith; King <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith very well that one ſinne entiſeth another, conſidering that of idleneſſe commeth looking, of looking deſiring, of deſiring conſenting, of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting doing, of doing perſeuering, of perſeuering damning himſelfe, in ſo much that wee goe from ſinne vnto ſin in poſt haſt, vntill we be benighted in hell. <hi>Iucundus home qui miſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, &amp; commodat, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith <hi>Dauid</hi> in his hundred &amp; eleuenth Pſalme, as if hee would ſay.

Who hath ben mercifull vnto his brother in this world, vnto whom God hath not beene the like in the other? who hath imparted his goods vnto the poor, vnto whom God hath not imparted his glory? who hath brideled his tongue, who hath not benregar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded &amp; reſpected for it? What greater reward would he haue which vſeth mercy, or he which giueth alms of his ſubſtance or he who hurteth no man with his tongue, then that oth and promiſe which the Prophet ſpeaketh of, <hi>Quòd in aternum non commouebitur,</hi> that although he be neuer ſo much vexed and beaten with temptations, yet our Lord will not ſuffer him to be ouerthrown. S. <hi>Barnard</hi> ſaith vpon <hi>Qui habitat,</hi> O good Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:3666:44"/>O the glory of my ſoul, if my hart be aſſured by thee that he ſhal not bee moued for euer, what doe I weigh it if pride beate me, if anger moue mee, if enuy moleſt me, yea and the fleſh diſquiet me? when our Lord asketh of vs that we would be merciful, &amp; alms giuers, &amp; fair ſpoken, it is a very ſmal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that he asketh of vs, conſidering that which he doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe for it: for for to be aſſured, that neither in aduerſity which may come vnto him, nor proſperity which hee may happen vnto, <hi>Quòd in aeternu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> that his heart ſhall neuer bee moued, is ſuch a great matter that it can neither bee bought with the weight of tears, nor deſerued by heroicall deeds. The contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnto all this was found in wicked <hi>Iudas:</hi> for in ſteed of pitty he was cruel, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering how he had no regard vpon the poor, &amp; in ſtead of almes-giuing he ſtole the almes from Chriſt, &amp; inſtead of brideling his tongue he ſold his God &amp; Lord vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Synagogue; and how could <hi>Iudas</hi> the theefe haue pity on the poor which begged among the people, ſeeing he ſtole the alms which they gaue vnto Chriſt? If it be a ſin to ſteale from a rich man, yea that which hee aboundeth with; ſhall it not be a ſin &amp; a wicked ſacriledge to ſteale from the poor that which they haue neceſsity of? whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe of Chriſts holy col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge did eat the ears of corne for pure hunger, they would rather haue earen bread and meat if they had had money to buy it. If <hi>Iudas</hi> did ſee Chriſt deuide the apoſtles alms to the needy poor, he ſhould nor only not haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it as a reproch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing &amp; diſhoneſt, but rather he ſhould haue ben thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and glad for it, becauſe there is no worke of mercy which is not in this world comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, and in the other rewarded. It is a certaine thing that the eues wiſh not well vnto the poore, becauſe a theefe will neuer come to him whom he thinketh will aske ſomething of him, but vnto thoſe from whome they imagine they can ſteale ſomewhat away. <hi>Fulgentius</hi> ſaith in a ſermon; If ſorrowfull <hi>Iudas</hi> had beene loiall vnto his maiſter, mercifull vnto the poore, friendly with the Apoſtles, diſciplinable in his manners, and not deſirous of other mens goods, our Lord would neuer haue left him to haue gone
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:3666:45"/>out of his colledge, nor hee euer haue committed treaſon. Who made thee O <hi>Iudas</hi> ſtumble and fall into ſuch enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and greeuous ſins, but thy ſmall or rather no pity? When the ſcripture accuſeth the traitor <hi>Iudas</hi> that he had no care of the needy, it is a matter both to make vs afeard, and alſo to wonder at; becauſe that in the ſight of our Lord, the almes which we doe vnto the poore are much more accepted, than the ſacrifice and incenſe which we offer him. <hi>Iudas</hi> is alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of that which hee did in the parlar where hee ſupped, when Chriſt ſaid. <hi>Ecce manus tradentis me,</hi> as if hee would ſay; O my diſciples, O my only ſons and companions, truly I open and diſcouer one thing vnto you: that is, that one of you which are here with me, hath ſold me by treaſon, and which is worſt of all, hee doth eat with mee at my table and at my owne diſh. Chriſt complaineth that <hi>Iudas</hi> ſold him vnto the Synagogue, and that hee ſate at his table with him, and that he did eat with one hand only, and that he was aſhamed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the one nor of the other: and there is none of this ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken without a great myſterie. <hi>Confundimini &amp; crubeſcite ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per viis veſtris ô domus Iſrael,</hi> ſaid God by <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> chap. 6, as if hee would ſay: O houſe of Iſrael, O ye people of Iuda, bee now aſhamed of the filthy works which you doe, and of the wicked ſteps yee walke in. For I am much more offended to ſee how little you eſteeme of me, then of the offences which you commit againſt me. A man which is of a noble and ſtour courage, and of a ſhamefaſt countenance, although hee haue beene offended and wounded by another, yet he doth not ſo much feele the iniury which is done, as he greeueth to ſee his enemy walke before his houſe; becauſe the brabble procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of anger, but the going about his houſe commeth from malice. <hi>Gregory</hi> vpon <hi>Ezechiel</hi> ſaith thus, Our Lord had great reaſon to complain of the houſe of Iſrael, &amp; of the kingdome of Iuda, and that not ſo much for the wickedneſſe they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, as for the ſmall ſhame they had in committing it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that hee wil either late or neuer amend, which is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed at all to haue offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded. It is to be noted that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:3666:45"/>ſaith, <hi>Erubeſcite de vijs veſtris,</hi> that is, that we ſhould bee aſhamed to walke our waies, becauſe to walke vnto the fleſh and the world there are many waies, which are all of vanity: but to walke vnto heauen there is but one way, which is of charity. What are our waies but onely our diſordinate and naughty deſires? Whither doe our deſires lead vs, but vnto vices, and from vices vnto ſins, and from ſins vnto hell? Then be aſhamed to ſinne or to haue ſinned: for as S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, The firſt ſtep to repentance is to bee aſhamed of the ſinne committed. What ſaith the ſon of God, when hee ſaith, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the hand of him which betraieth me: what elſe doth he ſay tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, behold the Traitor, behold wicked <hi>Iudas,</hi> who is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent to haue ſold me vnto the ſynagogue, but alſo ſitteth &amp; eateth at my table without any ſhame at all. The ſon of God could not haue ſpoken a word of greater iniury to <hi>Iudas</hi> than to call him Traitour: for after a man hath committed trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt another, there is neuer after any hope to be had of him, nor truſt to bee put in him. <hi>Iudas</hi> was a Traitor in ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Chriſt vnto thoſe vnto whome hee did ſell him: that is, vnto his mortall enemies, who bought him not becauſe hee ſhould ſerue them, but becauſe they would bee reuenged on him. <hi>Iudas</hi> was a traitor, for ſelling Chriſt for ſo baſe and vile a price, becauſe a luſtie and an able young man, as Chriſt was, was more worth if it had beene but to make a ſlaue of. <hi>Iudas</hi> was a Traitor in ſelling him vnto them, becauſe in doing of it he ſhewed great malice, and exceeding auarice, ſeeing hee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed with his enemies for him at the firſt word, &amp; hee neuer replied nor hucked one word vpon the ſale. <hi>Iudas</hi> was alſo a traitor, becauſe he went of his own voluntary wil to ſel Chriſt, not being asked nor induced vnto it by any, wherein he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his infamous condition &amp; wicked treaſon. For by ſo much the more ſins are offenſiue, by how much the occaſions were leſſe which cauſed vs to commit them. <hi>Iudas</hi> was alſo a Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in ſitting with Chriſt at his table, as though he had offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him in nothing: vvherein he ſhewed his ſmall conſcience and great impudency; for hauing as hee had the money in
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:3666:46"/>his purſe, for the which he ſold Chriſt, it was not reaſon hee ſhould haue eaten with him in his diſh. <hi>Remigius</hi> exclaimeth in an epiſtle: O vnto how many may Chriſt ſay now adaies, behold the hand of him which betraieth mee is at the table with me, all which like vnto <hi>Iudas</hi> either by vſury, or by ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony dare ſell Chriſt, and after eat with him at the ſame meſſe, prophaning and waſting church-goods, as though they had coſt Chriſt nothing! S. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayth, That there ſupped but one Traitor in the parlar with Chriſt, but now adaies in the table of his church there dineth &amp; ſuppeth an infinit number of Traitors: and that which cannot be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken without tears is, that neuer ſeruing nor benefiting the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike church at all, they eat and take away the fruit which Chriſt got vs with his precious bloud. Tell mee my brother, tell mee I pray thee, what difference is there betwixt thee which ſelleth Chriſt for ſinnes, and <hi>Iudas</hi> which ſold him for money? Is it not thinkeſt thou a greater ſinne to ſell Chriſt for other ſinnes, then for <hi>Iudas</hi> to ſell him for thirty peeces of money? The difference which I find betwixt thee who art a ſinner, and wicked <hi>Iudas</hi> who was a Traitor is, that hee ſold Chriſt but once, and thou ſelleſt him euery day and houre: and in ſo greeuous an offence there can be nothing more iuſt, that ſeeing thy treaſon is greater than his, that thy condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation alſo ſhould be greater than his. It is alſo to be weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Chriſt doth not ſay that <hi>Iudas</hi> did eat with him with both hands, but with one only; for hee ſaith: <hi>Ecce manum tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentis me;</hi> Behold the hand of him who betraieth me, which hee ſpake not without a ſecret myſterie. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ſayth thus, He who could haue ſeene <hi>Iudas</hi> in the parlar, ſhould haue ſeene how his heart was giuen to the deuill, his body vnto the world, his word vnto the Synagogue, his left hand vpon his purſe, and with his right hand hee did eat with Chriſt. <hi>Vbertinus</hi> ſayth, That he doth eat with the Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor <hi>Iudas</hi> at the table with one hand, who liueth in a mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, not with a purpoſe to follow Chriſt, but with an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to flee the perils of the world, and coker himſelfe with
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:3666:46"/>the goods of the monaſtery. <hi>Bonauenture</hi> ſayth, That then the religious man eateth with one handwith <hi>Iudas</hi> at Chriſts table, when he liueth in the monaſtery by neceſsitie, and not voluntarily, inſomuch that his body is in his cell, &amp; his heart in the market place. Thus then you haue had recited vnto you the heinous offences, which the Traitor <hi>Iudas</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and how iuſtly our Lord condemned him: ſo that now there remaineth onely to tell you of the perfections which were in the good theefe which died with Chriſt, and how iuſtly Chriſt tooke him to heauen with him.</p>

O <hi>Ieremy</hi> my friend and Prophet, poule the haire of thy head, and then caſt it vnder thy feet, and weepe and bewaile the Synagogue, becauſe now there is no truth in her mouth, and the faith of her Commonwealth is vtterly loſt.

If Iſrael do offend &amp; fall into the ſin of idolatry, how is the good Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> to be blamed, &amp; why is he commanded to poule his hair for it &amp; caſt it vnder feet? Hath not euery man think you inoughto do to weep for his own ſins, without weeping for other mens ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows? <hi>Hugo de ſancto victore</hi> anſwereth vnto this doubt vpon thoſe words, <hi>Defecerunt prae lachrimis oculi mei, Thren.</hi> 1. and ſaith that there is nothing more natural vnto good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to weep for the ſins of the wicked. The charity of the good is ſo great, &amp; the careleſnes oſſinners ſo idle, that the iuſt me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dofirſt weepe for the ſins of the wicked, then they do weep for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. O how many ſinners do we ſee in theſe daies, ſporting &amp; laughing in the world, for whoſe ſins the iuſt do weep and giue themſelues diſcipline? O that it would pleaſe the God of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the heart of him who ſinneth would receiue ſuch griefe as the iuſt in ſeeing him ſinne?

King <hi>Dauid</hi> did weepe for the death of his deare ſonne <hi>Abſolon,</hi> and not only becauſe hee was his ſon, but becauſe he ſaw him die in that euil eſtate. The ſon of God wept ouer the city of Ieruſalem, not only becauſe they would there kil him, but becauſe they wold neuer ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their wickednes. The Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> did weepe very much for the captiuity of his people, not ſo much becauſe they were in captiuity in Babilo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as becauſe they would not neither for that puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or any thing elſe leaue their idolatry: the great captain <hi>Ioſua</hi> with all the nobles of Iſrael wept, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his own life, which was not long, but becauſe they ſaw how ingrateful the ſynagogue was to god. The Prophet <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> wept when king <hi>Saule</hi> came fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the conqueſt of <hi>Amelech,</hi> not ſo much becauſe God had depriued him of a kingdome, but becauſe hee had falne into ſuch a great ſinne.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:3666:47"/>ſo much occupied in any thing as in drawing euill men to good life, and when they can neither by entreaty: nor threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning conuert them, then they betake themſelues to weep bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly for them. When <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſaid, <hi>Defecerunt prae lachrimis o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi mei,</hi> and when <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaid, <hi>Exitus aquarum, &amp;c.</hi> what elſe would they ſay, but that the eies of the one of them were failed for weeping for the paines which the people endured, and that the eies of the other were made a ſea of teares for the great wickedneſſe which he ſaw in Iſrael. <hi>Anſelmus</hi> in his meditations ſaith thus. O ſweet Ieſus, O my good Lord, if good men ſhould not aid me with their holy praiers, &amp; if ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men ſhould not helpe me to weepe for my grieuous offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, what would become of mee wicked and wretched crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thinkeſt thou, doth our Lord command holy &amp; iuſt men to weepe for our ſinnes, but becauſe he knoweth better then we our ſelues, that if we haue power to fall into ſins, yet that we cannot lift ourſelues out of them without his grace &amp; li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe? Who then is able to obtaine vs this grace, but he who is in ſtate of grace? It is to be noted, that in <hi>Ieremies</hi> weeping, our Lord commanded him firſt to poule his he are, then caſt it and tread it vnder his feet, and that then hee ſhould weepe ouer them: of all which things there is none which wanteth a ſecrete and a myſtery. What other things are the ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou: heares in the head, but the vaine and light cogitations which are in the mind? When he ſaith, That the oftner our heare is pouled and ſhaued, the more they encreaſe &amp; grow, what meaneth hee elſe, but that filthy and vnclean thoughts the more they are ſuppreſſed and kept vnder, the faſter they grow vpon vs? What doth he elſe mean when he comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>Ieremy</hi> not to pul vp his hear by the root, but only poule it; but only that if we be able to reſiſt vncleane thoughts, yet

The roots of the heare remaine alwaies in the head, and the rootes of vaine deſires continue alwaies in the ſoule; &amp; if our Lord dooth permit this, it is becauſe wee ſhould haue matter wherevpon to exerciſe our ſelfe in, and occaſion to merit the more.

What dooth the diuell watch at, or ouerwatch, but to ſee whether thou bee doubtfull in the faith of Chriſt? what haſt thou if thou haſt not true faith? what wanteſt thou, if thou wanteſt not the true faith of Chriſt? O good Ieſus, O the light of my ſoule, I beſeech thee that thou wouldeſt not depriue me of thy faith, that thou wouldſt not caſt me out of thy church, that thou wouldſt not take thy mercy fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me: for if thou wilt not ſuffer me to fall from thy faith, I ſhal alwaies haue a hope that in the end I ſhalbe ſaued.

If we compare the faith of the good theef with the faith of the old fathers, we ſhal find it to be true, that he did ſo far exceed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in faithfully beleeuing, as they did go beyond him in good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. How ſhould not. <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeue in God, conſidering how God ſpake vnto him from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue, and vſed him as if he had beene his particular friend? The thecues faith was greater tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his, becauſe that Chriſt neuer ſpake vnto him one
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:3666:49"/>word of beliefe, neither did hee euer ſee him in heauen, but only hanged vpon the croſſe. The Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> did beleeue in God, when he ſaw him ſit on high in his throne, beſet with thouſands of Seraphins; but the the eues faith was greater, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee neuer ſaw Chriſt but crucified, and accompanied with theeues. The Prophet <hi>Maiſes</hi> had faith when hee ſaw the God of Iſrael ſpeake vnto him out of a buſh, and that the buſh waſted nor burnt not; but the faith of the good theefe was greater than this, conſidering that hee ſaw Chriſt loaden with thorns, which burnt nor in ſhow, but in troth pierced his braine. S. <hi>Peter</hi> had faith, when hee ſaw Chriſt goe vpon the waters; but the good theefes faith was greater, conſidering he ſaw Chriſt not ſpurn the waters, but ſaw him bathed in bloud from the feet to the head. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> had faith when ſhe ſaw him raiſe her brother <hi>Lazarus</hi> from death to life who had beene foure daies dead; but the good theefe had greater faith then this, conſidering how he neuer ſaw Chriſt raiſe the dead, but only ſaw himſelfe die vpon the croſſe like a malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the Euangeliſt had faith when he had ſſept vpon our Lords breaſt, after he had ſupped vvith him in the parlar; but the theefes faith vvas greater then this, ſeeing that hee beleeued in the ſonne of God, not ſleeping vpon ſtis breaſt, but ſuffering vvith him by his ſide vpon the croſſe. S. <hi>Iames</hi> had faith vvhen hee ſavv Chriſt transfigured in the hill Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor and the Fathers of the old law adore him; but the good theefes faith was greater then this, conſidering hee ſaw not the ſonne of God transfigured but disfigured, hee ſaw not his face ſhine, but his body torne in pieces. O happy and glorious theefe, who but thou hath ſtoine the faith from the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue which of old ſhee was wont to haue, and ſtolne Chriſt from them in whom then they beleeued not? Impart and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide vnto me part of the faith which thou didſt ſteale from the Synagogue, and Chriſt which thou diddeſt rob away on the Mount of Caluary: for although I was not thy compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in ſuffering, yet now I will bee in beleeuing. That which I would haue thee impart vnto mee is, the entire faith which
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:3666:49"/>thou haſt, the holy wordes which thou ſpeakeſt, the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of bloud which thou ſheddeſt, the true confeſsion which of God thou makeſt, and the Chriſtian charity with the which thou doeſt correct the other theefe. O that this theefe hath a happy inheritance, ſeeing that with the theft of worldly things he eaſily got the gallowes, and with the theft which hee ſtole vpon the croſſe hee got glory. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> of the praiſe of the theefe ſaith thus; In whom O good Ieſus, in whom did thy holy faith remaine when thou diddeſt depart out of this life, but in thy ſorrowfull mother, who wept at the foot of the croſſe, &amp; in that holy theefe who ſuffered on thy ſide? O good Ieſus, O redeemer of my ſoule (ſaith <hi>Barnard</hi>) what a ſmall number of friends thou hadſt with thee on the croſſe, and what a multitude of enemies about thee, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that thou hadſt there but two faithfull Chriſtians, that is, thy bleſſed mother which did beleeue in thee with her heart, and that iuſt theefe which did confeſſe thee with his mouth. Seeing it was nothing elſe to be a Chriſtian, but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in Chriſt, and ſerue Chriſt, it is to be beleeued that this theefe was a Chriſtian, and that he died a Chriſtian: for if he had not ben one, he would neuer haue commended himſelfe vnto Chriſt, as wee doe our ſelues vnto God, vnleſſe hee had alſo beleeued him to bee God. <hi>Iſichius</hi> vpon <hi>Leuiticus</hi> ſaith, That we doe not doubt whether this theefe was baptiſed or not, but how hee was baptiſed, and where, wee know not; but that which wee doe know in this caſe is, that if there wanted water on the croſſe to baptiſe him, yet there wanted no blood to regenerate him. There was but one poole in the temple of Hieruſalem to heale men with, but on the Mount of Calua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry there are three fonts to baptiſe with; the one was ful of our Ladies teares, the other full of the water of our Lords ſide, and the third full of the bloud of his body. How could this theefe be vnbaptiſed, hauing ſuch great preparations to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe him? O my ſoule, O my heart, why doe you not baptiſe and waſh your ſinnes, why wipe you not away your wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in the tears of the ſweet mother, in the water of his gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:3666:50"/>ſide, and in the bloud of her holy ſonne? <hi>Ecce nunc in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquitatibus conceptus ſunt,</hi> Behold now I am conceiued inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or what offences could I haue committed, which the mothers tears could not waſh, and the ſonnes bloud could not inake clean? I will not now goe with <hi>Iudith</hi> to the fountaine of Modien to waſh mee; nor with <hi>Naaman</hi> to the waters of Iorda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bath me, nor to the poole at Ieruſalem with the ſick of the palſie to heale me, but I will goe onely vnto the holy fonts of the Mount of Caluary to baptize me, which are full of the bloud which my God ſhed, and of the water which iſſued out of his ſide. To conclude then, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, there was none preſent but S. <hi>Iohn:</hi> but in the baptiſme of this theefe there was Chriſt, and his mother, S. <hi>Iohn</hi> &amp; <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Magdalen,</hi> inſomuch that in the houſe of God they giue more honour to good theeues, then vnto thoſe which are naughty-Emperours.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted was a bold theft, when hee ſtole the bottle of water and the ſpeare from king <hi>Sauls</hi> boulſter: but the good theeues theft was more ſolemne, who ſtole not a launce from a boul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, nor a bottle of water, but he ſtole Chriſts body drie and without bloud, and his ſide which was pierced with a launce. <hi>Moiſes</hi> ſpies were craftie and ſubtile theeues, vvhich ſtole a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay the bunch of grapes of the land of promiſe: but the good theefe vvas farre more ſubtiler, ſeeing hee ſtole from thoſe vvho had ſtolne, not a bunch of grapes vvhich hanged, but Chriſt crucified.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:3666:53"/>deepe reaſons. I confeſſe for my owne part, that amongſt all the things which I haue read, or haue heard wiſe men ſpeake of, there is none that hath taken ſuch deep root in my memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, nor hath ſatisfied my iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t like vnto this cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſel of the wiſe man. For the better commending of which ſpeech I wiſh I had <hi>Homers</hi> vnderſtanding, <hi>Platoes</hi> wit, <hi>Diogenes</hi> phraſe, <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines</hi> art of Oratory, &amp; <hi>Ciceroes</hi> tongue. After this ſaying, &amp; in compariſon of it, there is nothing more to bee thought, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more to be ſought, nothing more to be ſaid, nor nothing more to be commended: for vnder this ſpeech is comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, al the goodnes that hath ben written vntil this day, &amp; all that which is neceſſary for thy ſaluation. This is a high doctrin, a wonderful ſaying, worthy to be heard, and true to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, iuſt to be taught, &amp; wholly to be obſerued. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith thus of it: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wiſe man ſaith, <hi>Omni cuſtodia,</hi> Keep thy hart with al watching, it is to ſay plainly, keep, keep, watch, watch, be aduiſed, be aduiſed, ſhut ſhut the gates &amp; entrance of thy heart: for it is he in whom our Lord deſireth to delight in, and that is he vvhom the deuill alſo would willingly poſſeſſe. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in a ſermon ſaith, The wiſe man ſaith not without cauſe, keepe thy heart with a carefull watch, conſidering that God and the deuill, and the diuell and God ſtriue not who ſhall poſſeſſe the eies wee doe ſee with, or the tongue which we ſpeak with, but only which of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> both ſhall houſe &amp; ſhut himſelf as in a caſtle in our harts which we bear: inſomuch that in the guard &amp; keeping of the hart conſiſteth our ſaluation or perditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith, That whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the wiſe man ſaith, <hi>Omni cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia cor tuu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cuſtodi,</hi> he doth forwarne vs &amp; aduiſe vs, that we put dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t watch &amp; ward ouer our fugitiue hart, becauſe the fleſh may not defile him, the world mooue him, the deuill deceiue him, the enemy ſteale him &amp; poſſeſſe him. What els doth he ſay whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he biddeth thee watch &amp; ward thy hart, but only that ſo much intereſt wee haue in Chriſt, how much hee himſelfe hath in our hearts. If God hath little in thee, thou haſt litle in God: if thou haſt much in God, god hath much in thee: &amp; ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou wouldeſt haue nothing of God but thy ſaluation, &amp;
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:3666:54"/>God would haue nothing of thee but thy heart, thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt highly to keepe it, and truſt it and commit it to none but vnto him. S. <hi>Gregory</hi> in his Morals ſaith, The counſell of the wiſe man is very deepe, and his aduiſe very diuine, when hee ſaith, Keepe thy heart with all watching, and the reaſon is, that becauſe all that which God giueth vs, and al that which wee offer vnto him is worth nothing if it bee not kept in the heart, and proceed from the heart: and therefore it is a very wholeſome thing that our hearts bee alwaies full of good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and very far from vaine thoughts. Tell mee I pray thee, why the wiſe man was not content to ſay, that wee ought to keepe the heart, but he added that we ſhould keep him with all watching and guarding, and put him in very great ſafetie? What other thing is it to keepe it with al guard, but only that wee ſhould not giue place for any vanity or folly to enter in? <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith in an Epiſtle, Wee ſee that the eies are defended with the eie lids, the mouth with the lips, the ears with a cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, the bands with gloues, the corne in the garner, and mony in cheſts: but no man is able to take away vaine deſires from the ambitious &amp; mutinous heart, nor cut off his light cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

And if this be true as true it is, that the heart is nothing elſe but reaſon, vvhat lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth he who loſeth his heart, and vvhat hath hee vvho hath not his heart? And therefore there are not any put into the houſe of innocents, or into Bedlem, becauſe they wanted a heart to liue with; but becauſe they want reaſon to gouerne themſelues with: &amp; for this cauſe is not he a verier foole who liueth not according to reaſon, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he who hath his heart mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted and troubled. <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith in his Timaeo; If a man doth loſe his eies, or feet, or hands, or his wealth, we may ſay of ſuch a one, that if he loſe, he loſeth ſomewhat; but hee who loſeth his heart &amp; reaſon loſeth all: for in the wombe of our mother the firſt thing which is engendred is the heart, and the laſt thing which dieth is the ſame heart.

No man hath two hearts, but hee who is malicious, no man hath two tongues but hee who cannot rule his tongue, no man hath two handes but the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous man, no man goeth two waies but the ambitious man, who for to haue more, and preuaile more, leaueth no way not gone, nor any eſtate not ſhot at or ſhake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. It is ſure a new thing &amp; not heard of before, that the wiſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dare ſay, that ſome ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath two tongues to murmure much with, &amp; ſome two hearts to think much with, &amp; in this caſe we dare well ſay that it is as monſtrous a thing to haue two harts, as to want one. <hi>Remigius</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe words ſaith, In things which do hinder the one the other, to vndo them is to win the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to ſeperate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is to flie from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; to cut the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſunder is to ſow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; to diminiſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is to encreaſe them, and to waſt them is to better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. the example of all this may bee giuen in trees which haue many boughes, and in a vine which hath many branches, whoſe ſuperfluitie if we doe cut off, wee make them grow, and the pruning of the vine maketh it fructifie. The Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> accuſeth Iſrael, becauſe he hath no heart at all; and <hi>Salomon</hi> reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the malicious man, becauſe hee hath two hearts: what meane ſhall we keep then to complie with the one, and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the other? <hi>Hugo de arra anima,</hi> anſwereth and ſaith, See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our loue ought to be but one, and he on whom we ought to beſtow our loue ſhould bee but one, in like manner the heart with whom we ſhould engage our loue, ſhould bee but one, becauſe that cannot be called true loue which is ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into many hearts. If we ſhould be permitted by the law of Chriſt to haue many loues, wee ſhould alſo bee ſuffered to haue many hearts: but ſeeing it is not permitted to haue more than one loue, why would we haue more than one heart? He in an Order of religion is ſaid to haue many hearts, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth with his body in the monaſtery, and with his will &amp; mind wandereth in the world, and ſo hee liueth with paine by
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:3666:56"/>reaſon of the one, and caſts out ſighes by reaſon of the other. The diſſembling hypocrite hath alſo two hearts, who with the one deſireth to bee in low degree, and with the other la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to be exalted; with the one he ſpeaketh fair, &amp; with the other he bireth ſecretly; with the one he proclaimeth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, &amp; with the other he maintaineth malice; &amp; which is worſt of all, with the one he doth forward concord, and with the other he ſtirreth vp war. Woe therfore be vnto him who hath two hearts: for if hee had but one, either hee would bee wholly good or wholly bad; but hauing two hearts, he cannot in religion do that which he ought, nor in the world doe that which hee would. Hee hath alſo two hearts, who hath good words and naughty vvorks, he vvhich crieth the ſpirit, &amp; is al fleſh, he vvho liueth wickedly &amp; hopeth vvell, he vvho is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous vvith other men, and mild vnto himſelfe, ſtrait vnto his brothers, &amp; liberall vnto himſelfe. Hath not he think you two harts, vvho promiſeth much &amp; performeth litle, he vvho ſweareth that he loueth, and yet in the end loueth not, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth? To come then vnto our purpoſe, all that vvhich I haue ſpoken, is to let you know hovv vviſely and vvarily the good theefe kept his heart, and hovv highly he did imploy it, ſeeing he denied it the diuel, &amp; offered it vnto Chriſt. Chriſt and the deuill vvere at a great variance vvhich of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould cary avvay the theeues hart, becauſe the deuil alledged that hee did belong vnto him, becauſe hee vvas a ringleader of theeues; and Chriſt ſaid that he did belong vnto him, becauſe he vvas the father of ſinners. But vvhen the theefe ſaid, Lord remember mee, the deuil fled, &amp; Chriſt defended the theefe. <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> ſayth, That <hi>Cain</hi> offered corne vnto God, <hi>Abel</hi> lambes, <hi>Noe</hi> Weathers, <hi>Abraham</hi> doues, <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> vvine, <hi>Dauid</hi> gold, <hi>Iepthe</hi> his daughter, and <hi>Anna</hi> her ſonne. If all theſe men did offer much vnto God, that vvhich the good theefe did offer vvas much more: for all that vvhich they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vvere externall thinges, and not their ovvne; but that vvhich the good theefe offered vvas his ovvne, and in this caſe there is great difference betvvixt offering that vvhich a
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:3666:56"/>man poſſeſſeth and keepeth in his houſe, and offering of his ovvne proper perſon. If any man aske thee vvhat that is that the theefe offered Chriſt, let him firſt anſvvere vvhat that vvas that he kept for himſelfe for giuing as he did, all vvhich he had vnro Chriſt, he vvas not ſeene to reſerue any thing for himſelfe. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith in an Epiſtle, Who is he vvho giueth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother all vvhich he can, vvho doth not giue him alſo his vvil and al that he hath? The good theefe gaue Chriſt al that he could, all that he vvas vvorth, all his povver, all that hee poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, &amp; alſo al his might &amp; vvill, at vvhat time he acknovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged himſelfe a ſinner vpon the altar of the croſſe, and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to be his redeemer. O good ſinner, O glorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor; vvilt thou not tel vs vvhat thou diddeſt offer vnto thy God, ſeeing thou didſt obtain ſuch grace by it? The theef of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered not his eies becauſe they vvere couered, neither his mony becauſe the iailor had it, nor his coat becauſe the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had it, nor his body becauſe it vvas crucified; he had only left his tongue, vvith the vvhich he confeſſed Chriſt, and his hart vvith the vvhich he beleeued in him. If he vvould haue giuen Chriſt his honour, hee knevv not vvhere it vvas, if hee vvould haue ſerued Chriſt vvith his life, it vvas novv at an end, if hee vvould haue beſtovved his goods vpon him, hee had none left: for he loſt his honor and credit by his theft, his life <hi>Pilat</hi> commanded to be taken from him, and all his goods the office of the Fiskall poſſeſſed. O high my ſtery (ſaith <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi>) O diuine example, vvho being put vpon the tree, had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left but his heart, and vvith that he beleeued in Chriſt, and his tongue, and vvith that he commended himſelfe vnto God. It is to be beleeued, that if this good theefe had had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing elſe left but his tongue and his hart, that vvith more he vvould haue ſerued Chriſt: inſomuch, that vve cannot co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn his offering for a mean and miſerable gift, ſeeing he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered God al which he had: For vvhat doth he not offer vvho offereth his heart? what doth hee not deuide vvho deuideth his heart? O my tongue, O my heart, vvhy doe you not take for your companion this theefe crucified vpon the tree,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:3666:57"/>becauſe he may teach you how ſins are bewailed, &amp; the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens ſtolne away? <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſaith, I think I ſhal neuer bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but I haue a great hope I ſhall bee ſaued, ſeeing that the good theefe being alone, &amp; crucified vpon the croſſe, by no other means but by offering his heart &amp; tongue vnto God in leſſe than halfe an houre, went into glory. S. <hi>Barnard</hi> ſayth, O good Ieſus, O the hope of my ſoule, why ſhould I torment my ſelfe and bee ſorrowfull, if I want feet to goe to glory, or haue no eares to heare ſermons, nor haue no riches to giue almes, nor iewels to offer in the temples? Seeing that I hold it for certaine, that with one holy wiſh I ſhall content thee O ſweet Ieſus. <hi>Moyſes</hi> ſiſter was ſcabby, noble <hi>Lia</hi> was bleare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied, good <hi>Moiſes</hi> ſtutted in his ſpeech, holy <hi>Tobias</hi> was blind, <hi>Mimphiboſeth</hi> was lame: yet notwithſtanding al theſe defects and imperfections, nothing hindered them from being vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and holy. If our hearts be cleane and whole, what careth God if our members bee rotten? The great Patriarke <hi>Iacob</hi> bleſſed his ſons being blind, dogs licked the wounds of holy <hi>Lazarus</hi> legs, patient <hi>Iob</hi> did wipe and ſhaue off the wormes of his fleſh with a tile ſtone, holy <hi>Tobias</hi> ſaw nothing but what his children directed him vnto, but none of all theſe things hindered them from ſeruing their Lord and God, and from helping their neighbors &amp; brothers to ſaue themſelues. <hi>Remigius</hi> ſaith, Behold O my ſoule, behold, the good theefe had ſentence to die vpon the croſſe, with his ioints ſeuered the one from the other, his eies couered, his fleſh rent &amp; torn, his bloud ſhed, and yet notwithſtanding al this, with his hart which only liued, he knew how to remedy and ſaue himſelfe. In ſo few houres, in ſo ſhort a ſpace, the pennance which the good theefe did, could not be great, nor the ſighes which hee gaue could not bee many; yet becauſe hee gaue them ſo from his heart, and with ſuch great deuotion, Chriſt tooke them in a ſort for a iuſt account; &amp; not only thoſe which the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he gaue, but alſo thoſe which he had a will afterward to giue, if death had not cut him off.</p>

The ſonne of God the night before his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, being at his praiers in the garden of Gethſemani, when all the torments which he was afterwards to ſuffer, came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his mind, and the torment of the death which hee was to endure, ſaid vnto his eternall father, <hi>Pater ſivis, tranſeat a me talix iſte,</hi> as if he would ſay. My eternal and holy father, I ask thee as thy ſon, and beſeech thee as thou art my father, that thou wouldeſt conſent, that all thoſe of my church may alſo drink of this cup of bitternes. The doubt now is, that ſeeing the cup that Iſrael taſted of, was fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as good a God as the cup that Chriſt drank of, why the cup that Chriſt drank of was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued &amp; liked, &amp; the cup that Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> drank of miſliked &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed? The one was a cup, &amp; the other a cup: the one was of bitternes, and the other was of ire: the one fell to the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, &amp; the other to the church: the one was of God, &amp; the other was of God, &amp; ſeeing it is ſo, why do they threate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Iſrael, for that which hee drunk, and praiſe Chriſt for that which he ſupped vp? The better to vnderſtand this point, we muſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that there are two kind of cups or chalices in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcripture. To wit, the one which is called the chalice of bitterneſſe, &amp; the other which is called the chalice of ire, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:3666:58"/>the difference betwixt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is, that by drinking the one, we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear betimes in the morning in Paradiſe, &amp; by drinking the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we go down at night vnto hel. What is the cup of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ful of, but with hunger, cold, thirſt, perſecution, &amp; temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; all which things our Lord giueth to drinke, vnto all thoſe which hee hath choſen to ſerue him, and vnto all thoſe whom he hath predeſtinated vnto ſaluation. S. <hi>Gregory</hi> in his Morals ſaith. That it is a ſign that he is predeſtinated to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, vnto whom God giueth his cup of bitternes to drink; in ſo much that we cannot eſcape grieuous hels, vnleſſe it be by the coſt of great trauails. It is to be noted, that Chriſt ſaid not vnto his father, that he wold not drink of the cup, neither yet did he offer himſelf to drink vp al, but he praied him only by ſpeciall grace, that others might help him to drink it: for if he ſhould alone haue dronken the cup of bitternes, he alone ſhould haue entred into Paradiſe. O giuer of all goodnes, O diſtributer of al fauors, what hadſt thou that thou didſt not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, or what didſt thou poſſeſſe that thou didſt not deuide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt vs? Thou haſt giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs thy body to eat, thou haſt giuen vs thy bloud to drink, thou haſt giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs thy law to keep, thou haſt giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs thy hart to loue, thou haſt giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs thy cup to taſt, &amp; thou haſt giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs thy glory to enioy. <hi>Anſelmus</hi> ſaith, That in the vain pallaces of the world, thoſe are thought to be moſt familiar, which are moſt of all made much of by their Lord: but in the company &amp; houſe of God, thoſe are beſt beloued which are worſt handled; inſomuch that we wil ſay him to be his familiareſt friend, whom we ſhall ſee to drinke ofteneſt of his bitter cup. O high myſtery, O diuine Sacrament! when the ſonne of God did weepe teares from his eies in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and did ſweat bloud from his body, hee did not aske that his choſen flocke might bee cockered and made much of, but only that he wold let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſup ſome ſup of his bitter cup. What elſe was S. <hi>Peters</hi> croſſe, S. <hi>Andrews</hi> croſſe, likewiſe <hi>Bartolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mewes</hi> knife. S. <hi>Laurence</hi> grediron. S. <hi>Steuens</hi> ſtones, but certain pledges which they receiued of Chriſt, &amp; certain bitter ſups which they dranke of his chalice? <hi>Hilarius</hi> vpon S. <hi>Matthew</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:3666:58"/>ſaith, That how many more ſups a man hath ſupped in this life of Chriſts cup, ſo many ſteps the higher ſhall hee bee in heauen in glory: for what cauſe we ought to entreat and aske earneſtly, that if we cannot drink al his cup, yet that he would let vs at the leaſt raſt of him with his elect. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ſayth alſo, That although the cup which Chriſt left his elect, bee ſomewhat bitter in drinking, yet after that it is drunke, it is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerous and profitable, becauſe the trauels of this world doe not giue vs ſo great griefe and paine when wee ſuffer them, as they bring vs delight after we haue ſuffered them. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to bee noted that hee ſayth, <hi>Tranſeat a me calix iſte,</hi> that is, He would not haue his bitter cup turne backe againe, but goe on forward: wherby he giueth vs to vnderſtand, that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his paſsion, and the bloud of our redemption, ſhould not be beſtowed vpon them which euery day goe worſe and worſe vntill the end, but onely vpon them vvhich euery day grow better and better. This word of <hi>Tranſeat,</hi> Let this cup paſſe, is a high word, and worthy to bee marked, in the which and by the vvhich our good Ieſus doth admoniſh and warne vs, that thoſe ſhall not drinke of his cup of bitterneſſe, &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vvith him into glory, which hauing been good, turn in the end to be naught; but only thoſe vvho being naught, proue to be good: nor thoſe vvho vvhen they ſhould go forward from vertue to vertue, turne backward and perſeuere in vices, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that among the ſeruants of our Lord he vvho doth not profit doth diſprofit. There is no rich ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this world which doth ſet ſo much by his wealth, as Chriſt doth by his chalice of bitterneſſe: and therfore ſeeing that he commandeth that his cup ſhould paſſe further, &amp; that thoſe ſhould drink of him vvhich doe go forward, the ſeruant of our Lord ought to take pains to make himſelfe better, and to go forward, not in ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which doth te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt him, but in deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which he doth want. O good Ieſus, O my ſoules co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort, Let this cup go, not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me, but to me, becauſe we may taſt of thy pains &amp; trauels, feel thy griefes, weep for thy torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r, enioy thy loue, &amp; waſh away my wickednes; inſomuch that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy cup doth paſſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee, it
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:3666:59"/>may light vpon me. Let euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> make his prouiſion of wines of Illana, of Candie, of Dania, yet I for my comfort and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, doe aske of God that all the daies of my life I may deſerue to drinke of that bitter cup one drop. There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cup which is called the cup of the wrath and ire of God, of the which when I begin to ſpeake, my bowels open, my heart is troubled, and my ſoule is ſorrowfull, my fleſh trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth, and my eies alſo weepe. How is it poſsible that my hart ſhould diſpoſe, my penne write, my inke marke, and my paper ſuffer mee to write, how happy they are who eſcape the drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this cup; and how vnhappy they are which drinke of it? With this cup of ire God did threaten Ieruſalem, of this the Synagogue dranke, with this wicked Babilon was drunk, yea and this was the cauſe why all Iudea was loſt. S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> in an Homilie ſaith, He drinketh of the curſed cup of ire, who through his ſin falleth from the eſtate of grace, which is an euill aboue all the euils of this life, becauſe a ſoule with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grace is farre more deader than a body without a ſoule. When doeſt thou thinke that God doth ſuffer vs to drinke of the cup of his ire, but when hee forgetteth to hold vs vp with his hand through our demerite? When ſhall wee ſee whether we haue dronke of the cup of his wrath, but vvhen God is careleſſe in keeping vs from falling, and vvee ſlothfull in amending our ſelues? S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> vpon the Pſalmes ſayth, O vvhat a difference there is betwixt the vvrath of God, &amp; the vvrath of man, for they puniſh vvhen they are angry, but God forbeareth to puniſh vvhen hee is angry, in ſo much that God is more diſpleaſed vvhen hee diſſembleth a fault than vvhen he doth preſently puniſh. S. <hi>Barnard</hi> ſayth, That there is no greater temptation than not to bee tempted, nor greater tribulation tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not to be afflicted, nor greater puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than not to be puniſhed, nor yet a ſharper ſcourge than not to be ſcourged. For as there is ſmall hope of the ſick mans life vvhome the Phiſition doth diſtruſt and deſpaire of, euen ſo in like manner there is great occaſion to ſuſpect the ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that man vvhom our Lord doth not puniſh in this life.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:3666:59"/>It is alſo to be noted, that <hi>Eſay</hi> doth not only threaten Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, becauſe ſhe dronk of the cup of the ire of God, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe drunke alſo the dregs and lees, vntill ſhee left none, in ſo much that if there had ben more, more ſhe would haue drunk. We call that properly the dregs of the wine, that part of the wine which corrupteth and marreth, and that which goeth to the bottome, and that which rotteth and ſtinketh, and that whereof we receiue no profite. What are the dregs which ſinke vnto the bottome, but onely wicked ſinne which beareth vs into hell? The dregs of ſinne cauſe vs to rot, and with dregs of ſinne we ſinke, and by the dregs of ſinne we are damned, and by the dregs of ſin we are hated of God. I will viſite Ieruſalem and thoſe men which are faſtened in their dregs, ſaith God by the Prophet <hi>Sophonias</hi> in the firſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as if hee would ſay, I will viſite all the dwellers of Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and I will make no reckoning of other ſinnes and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but of ſuch as I ſhall find entangled, and tumbling in the dregs and lees. Who are thoſe which ſticke in the mire &amp; are bedurted with the dregs, but thoſe which ſtand obſtinately in their ſinnes and wickedneſſe? God complaineth not of thoſe which are defiled in the dregs, but on thoſe which are faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and fixed in them: for our Lord is not ſo much ſcandali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to ſee vs fall into ſinnes, as to ſee vs wallow and delight in their dregs and grounds. O that wicked is the heart which is faſtened, and ſtandeth firme in the dregs of ſinne, becauſe promiſes cannot allure and entiſe him, nor threatnings feare him, nor entreatie conuert him, nor puniſhment amend him, nor counſell profite him! How badly our Lord liketh of them which are firme in the lees and dregs, he ſheweth plainly, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he threatneth ſuch as ſtand faſt in them, and thoſe which drink of the cup vnto the dregs; wherof we may inferre that wee doe not ſo much condemne our ſelues for ſinning, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we will not goe out of ſinne. To drinke of the cup vnto the dregs is, as if as there are but ſeuen capitall ſins they were feuen thouſand, to haue a will to offend in them all before we died. To drinke vnto the dregs is, that if by deed we commit
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:3666:60"/>ten ſinnes euery day, in thought we commit an hundred euery houre. To drinke the cup vnto the dregs is, that if wee omit to commit any ſinne, it is not becauſe wee would not, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we could not or durſt not. To drinke of the cup vnto the dregs is, that not being content to ſinne, we commend and praiſe our ſelues for doing it, as if we had done our Lord ſome notable ſeruice. To drinke the cup vnto the dregs is, that when wee haue committed all kind of ſinnes, yet wee cannot endure to be called ſinners. To drinke the cup vnto the dregs is, to be ſo graceleſſe and ſhameleſſe in ſinning, that we entiſe and importunately vrge others to do the like. To drinke the cup vnto the dregs, is to hate our neighbour with our heart, iuiurie him with words, and hurt him in deeds. Loe thus then haue I told you what is the cup of bitternes which the elect and choſen drinke of, and which is the cup of wrath and ire which the wicked drinke of: in ſo much that if wee would know who ſhall bee ſaued, or who damned, wee are onely to mark what cup he dranke of. To come then vnto our purpoſe, we muſt ſuppoſe that theſe two theeues drank of both theſe cups, which are ſo dreadfull and wonderfull; and ſuch as the cup was, of which ech of them dranke, ſuch was the reward or puniſhment which on the croſſe ech of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> receiued and carried away. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the naughty theefe ſaid vnto Chriſt, ſaue thy ſelfe and vs, he dranke of the cup of wrath, and when the good theefe ſaid vnto Chriſt, Lord remember me, he dranke of the cup of bitterneſſe, inſomuch that the one drank of the pure wine, ſeeing he went into heauen, and the other dranke of the ſtinking dregs, ſeeing he went into hel. What meaneth this O good Ieſus, what meaneth this? Seeing they were both co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions, both the eues, both hanged, both ſaw Chriſt, and both were neere vnto Chriſt, why doe they giue to the one to drinke of the cup of glory, and vnto the other the cup of ire? S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> anſwereth vnto this &amp; ſayth. Why God doth giue light vnto one, and not vnto another, why he draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this man and not that man, I pray thee good brother goe not about to ſeeke out the reaſon, if thou wilt not bee decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued:
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:3666:60"/>for all this dependeth of Gods high iudgements, the which although they be ſecret, yet notwithſtanding they be not vniuſt. <hi>Origen</hi> vpon <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith; As there are many things in the heart which are not of the heart, and as there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in war<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> which take no pay in the warre, ſo the naughty theefe was vpon the croſſe, not hauing the fruit of the croſſe: for in ſtead of asking Chriſt that he would pardon him, be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked that he would deliuer him and vnbind him. If thou bee Chriſt, ſaith the naughty theefe, ſaue thy ſelfe and vs, as if he would ſay, If thou bee the Chriſt which the Iewes hope for, deliuer thy ſelfe from death, and quite vs from paine. <hi>Cyprian</hi> vpon the paſsion of our Lord ſayth; O that, that is a wicked word and a deteſtable praier which thou O naughty theefe doeſt vtter with thy mouth, when thou doeſt perſuade the ſon of God to come downe from the croſſe: for if he do ſuffer &amp; die, it is for nothing that toucheth him, but for that which toucheth thee and is moſt expedient for me. Why doſt thou aske him that hee would ſaue thee and alſo himſelfe, ſeeing that he ſuffereth of his owne accord, &amp; dieth for thy naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe? The beginning of this naughty theeues perdition was, when he ſaid, if thou be the ſonne of God, and not, thou art the ſon of God: in which words it ſeemed that hee doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted whether hee were the ſonne of God or not; and ſo hee doubted in his faith, and made a ſcruple, whether he were the redeemer of the world or not, and ſo hee fell into infidelitie, which is the higheſt wickedneſſe of all other. <hi>Cyrillus</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, That the good theefe ſaid not, If thou be Chriſt, neither did S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſay, I beleeue if thou bee Chriſt; but the one ſaid faithfully, Lord remember me, and the other likewiſe ſaid, I beleeue, becauſe thou art the ſonne of God, inſomuch that no man can be lightened or pardoned which maketh any doubt at all in the faith of Chriſt. The Apoſtle ſaith in his canonicall Epiſtle, if any man want wiſedome, let him aske it of God, not doubting in faith: as if he would ſay, If any man haue need of any great matter, let him take heed that he do not aske it with a faith that is luke warme: for if our Lord do
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:3666:61"/>not grant vs that which we aske him, it is rather becauſe wee know not how to ask him, than becauſe hee hath not a deſire to giue it. <hi>Damaſcen</hi> ſayth, If he who asketh be not a Pagan, and that which he asketh bee not vniuſt, and hee who asketh be holy, and the place where he asketh be alſo ſacred, and he for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he asketh be needy, why ſhould he doubt to obtaine it, conſidering that of himſelfe hee is ſo mercifull? O good Ieſus, O my ſoules pleaſure, giue me thy grace that I may ſay vvith the blind man in <hi>Ieremie,</hi> O ſonne of <hi>Dauid</hi> haue mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy vpon mee: and keepe mee from ſaying vvith the naughty theefe, if thou be Chriſt ſaue thy ſelf and me too; ſeeing that like a true Chriſtian I confeſſe thy mighty power, and call for thy great mercy. <hi>Chriſtoſtome</hi> ſaith, The naughty theeſe thought, that as <hi>Pilate</hi> had condemned him for a robber by the high way, ſo he had executed iuſtice vpon Chriſt for ſtirring the people to ſedition, and that Chriſt did no leſſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of his life, than hee did abhorre death: vvherein cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he vvas much deceiued; for he did not ſo earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to liue as Chriſt did deſire to die. The Iews perſuaded Chriſt that hee ſhould come downe from the croſſe, and this naughty theefe did alſo perſuade him that hee vvould ſlie from the croſſe, that vvhich the ſonne of God did not loue to hear of, nor would not do: for if he had forſaken the croſſe all the vvorld ſhould haue beene crucified. S. <hi>Barnard</hi> ſayth, I doe not deſire thee my good Ieſus, that thou come down fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the croſſe, nor that thou ſlie from the croſſe, but that thou vvouldeſt put me there with thee, becauſe it would be more reaſonable that they ſhould giue ſentence vpon me for thee, than that they ſhould giue ſentence vpon thee for me. It may bee gathered of all that which wee haue ſpoken, what great courage we haue need of to begin any good worke, and a far greater to finiſh it: for our enemies are ready alwaies about to deceiue vs, the fleſh to mooue vs, men to hinder vs, and the world to trouble vs.</p>

The God and Lord which I preach vnto you O Romanes, dooth commend nothing more vnto you than charity, in louing your neighbours with all your heart: the which loue you muſt ſhew them, not ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they loue you, as becauſe they ſerue God. Holy <hi>Paule</hi> did preach and teach vs many things, whereof ſome were to make vs afeard, ſome to giue vs counſell, ſome to teach vs, ſome to comfort vs, as this matter which we now handle, the which being wel looked into, and read with attention, we ſhal find that hee giueth vs as much as hee hath, and loueth vs as much as he ought. For the better vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding of this ſpeech, we muſt ſuppoſe that the loue of God, charity, and grace, go alwaies coupled together, in ſo much that no man can haue heauenly loue without heauenly charity, &amp; no man can haue heauenly charity, but he muſt haue heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly grace, &amp; he who hath heauenly grace, cannot faile but goe to glory. <hi>Damaſcen</hi> ſayth, That Loue, and Charitie, and Grace, are only one gift, and the greateſt which came from heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; &amp; is called Grace, becauſe it is giuen without any price, and it is called Charity becauſe it is high, and it is called Loue becauſe it doth ioine and vnite vs with God: in ſo much that when he recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth his Charity vnto vs, he truſteth his Loue with vs. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Lord doth commend vs his Loue, as a thing left to keepe

In figure of all this, the altar of the Synagogue was all hollow, but the altar of the church is maſsie and ſound, by reaſon of the feruent loue which God beareth vs, and great charitie and mercy which hee doth vs. It is much to bee noted, that God doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend vnto vs, Faith, Hope, Patience, and Chaſtitie, but only Charitie: in which words hee giueth vs to vnderſtand, that if we doe ſet much by that which our Lord giueth vs, we ought to eſteeme much more of the loue with the which hee doth giue it vs. <hi>Iſidorus</hi> ſayth, That all the courteſies which our Lord doth promiſe vs, and all the perſuaſions vvhich hee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth vnto vs, are to no other end, but becauſe vve ſhould bee thankfull vnto him, and becauſe vve ſhould be mercifull vnto our neighbours. What vvanteth hee vvhich vvanteth not

Wherein doeſt thou thinke (ſaith S. <hi>Ierome</hi>) that all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an charity doth conſiſt, and al the health of thy ſoule, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſeruing of Chriſt with all our heart, and in labouring to profit and benefit our neighbour? What greater good can I doe vnto my brother, than put him in the right way if hee be out, and correct him if hee bee naught? <hi>Bede</hi> ſayth vpon this matter, That true and chaſt loue, may bee deuided betwixt God and our neighbour, ſo as our neighbor be not prowd and naught: for if he be ſo, we are to wiſh his ſaluation, and flie his conuerſation. Wee haue ſpoken all this, to declare the great charity which this good theefe had, and alſo vſed towards the naughty theefe, ſeeing that vpon the croſſe, hee taught him that which was conuenient for him, &amp; reprehended him in that which he ſpake. <hi>Neque tu times deum, qui in eadem dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natione es?</hi> ſaid the good theefe vnto the bad: as if he would ſay, O my friend and companion, I wonder much at thee, that hauing beene of ſuch a naughty life and conuerſation, and being vpon the very point to die, I ſay I maruel that thou da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt to crucifie this holy Prophet more with thy tongue, than the hang men doe, with their nailes; becauſe the nailes doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his vains, but thy euill tongue doth rend his entralls. The good theefe vſed but few wordes, but they contained many myſteries, and therefore it is needfull that they be read with attention, and written with grauity. It is to bee noted, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our Lord God be preſent in all things with his power, yet hee is much more in mans heart, and tongue by grace; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe are the two parts with the which we doe moſt of all pleaſe or offend God with. S. <hi>Aug.</hi> ſaith, That the eies doe loth oft to ſee, the ears to hear, the hands are loth to work, &amp; the feet to go, yea &amp; the body to ſinne; but the heart is neuer
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:3666:63"/>weary of thinking, nor the tongue with ſpeaking. <hi>Cor mundum crea in me deus, &amp; pone cuſtodiam ori meo,</hi> ſaid the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid:</hi> as if he would ſay, I beſeech thee O good Lord, that thou wouldeſt renue this heart within me, &amp; put a watch vnto this mytongue, becauſe that al the other parts of my body can but trouble &amp; offend me, but the heart &amp; tongue can trouble me &amp; damne me. S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, That it is a certein token, that we are in Gods fauor, when he doth giue vs grace to keep our hearts clean, &amp; our tongues brideled, becauſe the foundation of all Chriſtian goodnes is to beleeue our Lord God with all our hearts, &amp; praiſe him with our tongue. <hi>Ego dabo eis cer nouu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> ſaid God vnto Iſrael, &amp; I will open thy mouth ſaid God vnto <hi>Ezechiel;</hi> as if he would ſay, I will lighten thy heart O Iſrael, to the end that thou maiſt beleeue in me, and I will open thy mouth O <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> to the end that thou maiſt preach my name: for thou haſt obtained no ſmall gift, if thou come to know me, &amp; learn wel to ſet forth my name. To come the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our purpoſe, the grace of a new heart which God gaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Iſrael, and the gift of praiſing his name, which he gaue <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiel,</hi> Chriſt alſo gaue vnto the good theef which was neer vnto him, ſeeing he touched his heart, with the which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued in him, &amp; opened his mouth with the which he prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched his name. <hi>Vbertinus</hi> ſaith, That this good theefe was an excellent preacher in the church of God, who in a ſort ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to goe before the Apoſtles in faithfully beleeuing, and preaching Chriſts might and power. What greater maruell wouldſt thou haue the bloud of Chriſt worke (ſaith <hi>Rabanus</hi>) tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make preachers of theeues &amp; robbers? the pulpit in the which hee preached was the croſſe, the preacher was the the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The office of a preacher is (ſaith Saint <hi>Gregory</hi>) <hi>Secreta reſerarae, vitia extirpare, &amp; virtutes inſerere.</hi> The duty of a
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:3666:63"/>preacher is, to open the ſecrets of the ſcripture, extirpate vice out of the Commonwealth, and teach how our ſoules are to be ſaued. What greater ſecret can there bee than to confeſſe and preach a man crucified to bee God? Who reprehended vices like vnto this theefe, ſeeing that hee confeſſed himſelfe to be a ſinner, and accuſed the other theefe to bee a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: who did teach the way to heauen better tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this theef, ſeeing hee was almoſt the firſt that went thither? The good theefe deuided his ſermon into foure parts: the firſt was when hee rebuked the other theefe, when hee ſaid, <hi>Neque tu deum times:</hi> the ſecond when hee accuſed himſelfe to bee naught, ſaying, <hi>Nos quidem iuſtè patimur:</hi> The third when he excuſed Chriſt: ſaying, <hi>Hic autem quid mali fecit?</hi> The fourth when hee craued pardon for his ſinnes, <hi>Domine memento mei,</hi> Lord remember mee. Seeing then that the preacher is but a new preacher, &amp; the pulpit new, and the thing that he preacheth new, it is reaſon that wee ſhould heare that which hee prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth with attention, and do that which he counſelleth with great deuotion. <hi>Auferetur zelus meus ate &amp; quieſcam, ne iraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car amplius,</hi> ſaid God by <hi>Ezechiel</hi> chap. 16: as if he would ſay. O thou Synagogue which art hardened, ſeeing that thou wilt not beleeue that which I tel thee, nor doe that which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand thee, I am determined not to chide thee nor puniſh thee for any fault that thou ſhall commit, but as being incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible, I am determined to forſake thee. O ſorrowful ſpeech, O dreadfull word: when our Lord ſaith that he will aduiſe vs no more what we haue doe, nor correct vs of that which wee doe: for if he take his mercifull hand from vs, what ſhall wee dare to take in hand? Tell me I pray thee what can we doe, or what doe we know of our ſelues, if wee bee not guided by the hand of God, in that which wee take in hand, and aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed in that which wee doe amiſſe? S. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith vpon <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiel.</hi> When our Lord ſaith by <hi>Ezechiel</hi> that he will be no more angry with vs, it is a ſigne that hee is very angry with vs, becauſe it is a propertie of our Lord neuer to bee ſo angry as when hee is not angry to ſee vs offend. <hi>Barnard</hi> ſaith, O good
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:3666:64"/>Ieſus the light of my ſoule, I beſeech thee that thou take not thy zeale from mee, nor withdraw thy puniſhing hand from me; but as I commit a fault, ſo let thy puniſhment bee ready: for by this means I ſhall ſooner amend, &amp; liue alſo more wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. When the father of a company doth not puniſh a peruerſe ſeruant, it is a ſigne that he will put him out of the houſe; and when they let a ſick man eat all things that he luſteth, it is a ſign that he wil die: &amp; ſo whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God doth let vs go with the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle looſe in our own hand after what vices we luſt, it is a token that wee goe altogether out of the way. O how indurate that man ought to be in ſin, and how he ought to be mired in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, of whom God ſayth, <hi>Auferetur zelus meusate!</hi> For when God ſaith that hee will not loue vs any more with rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, what doth hee mean elſe, but that he will be careleſſe and forgetfull of vs, and forſake to puniſh vs? The holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture maketh mention of two kinds of zeale; the one is holy and glorious, and it is that which God hath towards vs; &amp; the other is common, and is that zeale which wee beare towards our neighbours: and if the one be neceſſary, the other is more neceſſary, becauſe the true zeale and loue of our neighbour conſiſteth not ſo much in helping him to maintaine himſelfe, as in directing him to ſane his ſoule. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in a Sermon ſayth, What doth it auaile thee O my friend, that thou help thy neighbour in time of neceſsitie with thy money, if thou conſent vnto him and hee with thee to wallow in vices? O how far a greater good turne thou ſhouldeſt doe him in leſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his faults, than by augmenting his wealth, becauſe there is no greater riches vnder the heauen, than to haue a cleane conſcience! The good theefe had a great zeale that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould bee ſaued, ſeeing hee did rebuke him for being a blaſphemer, and perſuaded him to be a Chriſtian: inſomuch that for a recompence for helping him to ſteale, hee would alſo helpe him to die well. <hi>Chryſiſtome</hi> vpon this matter ſayth, Theſe two theeues had kept companie a long time to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and deuided equally their prey betwixt them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that as there was no difference betwixt them in the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:3666:64"/>fault, ſo they would haue equall ſhares in the deuiſion. Now the good theefe would haue continued his old vſe, and as he had ſtolne heauen there vpon the croſſe, ſo he would haue deuided part of it vnto his companion, if the Lord of the theft, which was Chriſt, would haue conſented vnto it, or if the wretched theefe had deſerued it. O how great and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable a charity was this of the good theeues! for conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that himſelfe was a Chriſtian, hee would haue made the other one alſo, and ſeeing himſelfe the heire of heauen, he would haue taken the other thither with him, and ſeeing himſelfe pardoned, hee would haue gotten pardon for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but that hee would neither beleeue in Chriſt, nor with good will giue eare vnto his companion. It is much to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (ſayth <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi>) that the good theefe ſaid firſt vnto the bad, Neither thou doeſt feare God, before hee ſaid, Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member me. For as I ſuppoſe, it helped much to ſaue the good theefe, that Chriſt ſaw with what great charity hee laboured that his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion ſhould not caſt away himſelf. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaid firſt in fauor of the other, Neither thou doeſt feare God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee ſpake in the behoofe of himſelfe, Lord remember me; is it not moſt manifeſt and clear, that he deſired as much that his companion ſhould bee conuerted, as himſelfe ſaued? <hi>Remigius</hi> ſayth, That among all the ſeruices which wee can doe vnto our Lord, there is none ſo great, as to help our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to ſaue himſelfe, and contrariwiſe, there is none that doth more offend him, than to helpe our neighbour to damn him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; becauſe it ſeemeth that wee make ſmall account of the ſhedding of his bloud, if we helpe him not to beſtow it well. Then we beſtow his glorious bloud well, when we cauſe it to benefit our brothers: for otherwiſe we may ſay, that it was wel ſhed by Chriſt, but euilly beſtowed by vs. What greater ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice can I doe vnto our Lord, than draw my neighbor from ſinne, who hath been redeemed by his precious bloud? The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I draw my brother out of ſinne, when I correct him with my tongue, and help him in his worke. For as touching the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of our Lord, it is conuenient not only to aduiſe &amp; counſell
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:3666:65"/>him, but if we can alſo puniſh and chaſtiſe him. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his booke of Martyrs ſayth, Who dare now adaies like vnto Phinees thruſt through with a poynyard a bold Iew and a ſhameleſſe Gentile? Who like vnto holy <hi>Samuel</hi> will weepe for the diſobedience of <hi>Saule?</hi> Who like vnto holy <hi>Iob</hi> will riſe earely in the morning to offer ſacrifices of peace for the ſinnes of his ſonnes? Who like vnto the High prieſt <hi>Aaron</hi> will threaten <hi>Pharaoh</hi> within his own pallace, becauſe hee ſhould leaue off the ſeruice of his God in the Synagogue? Who will loſe the light of his eies like vnto the good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ieremy</hi> in weeping and taking pity vpon thoſe who carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away thoſe of Babilonia captiues? Now the zeale of holy men is loſt, now the feruency of good men is at an end, now the puniſhment of naughty men is forgotten; for becauſe that in matter of correction, a friend will rather venter his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with his friend, then ſuffer him to loſe his credite. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is no credite, but a diſcredit, no charity but cruelty to ſuffer his neighbour to damne himſelfe for want of correcting him: for oftentimes naughty men would amend themſelues of their errors, if their friends which they haue, would aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe them of them. Seeing wee cannot auoid it, but ſtumble at euery foot, nor giue ouer ſinning more or leſſe, why haue wee friends and companions, but becauſe they ſhould keepe vs vp with one hand from falling, and lift vs vp with the other, if they ſee vs downe? S. <hi>Barnard</hi> in an Epiſtle ſaith, Let no man leaue off the correcting of his neighbour and friend, becauſe he thinketh that by ſo doing, he doth diſpleaſe him: for after he hath conſidered of the matter, hee ſhall perceiue that hee hath done a good worke; becauſe that oftentimes the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell which they giue vs, is more worth tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the money which they lend vs.</p>

S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> vpon the words of our Lord ſayth, That in the trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant church loue without feare worketh; but in the militant church, loue and feare goe together: and a ſigne of this is that the greater loue I beare my friend, the greater feare I haue to diſpleaſe him. <hi>Cyrillus</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, Although the ſon of God ſaid, <hi>Ignem veni mittere in terram,</hi> which was as much as to ſay, that he builded his church vpon loue, yet he tooke not his feare from her: becauſe that ſeeing that there is both mercy and iuſtice in God, wee are bound aſwell to feare his rightfull iuſtice, as we are to loue his mercy. When God gaue <hi>Moiſes</hi> the old law, hee gaue it him with great thunders and terrible lightnings, and with al mixed it with many threats, &amp;
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:3666:66"/>ordained it with many puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts: becauſe the Iews ſhould determine with themſelues to keepe it, and not in any wiſe to breake it. King <hi>Pharaoh</hi> commanded all the midwiues of the kingdome of Egypt to ſlay al the male children of the Iews at the time of their birth: and becauſe they would not doe it for fear of the Lord, the Lord gaue them great riches in their houſes. The ſcripture commendeth very much a ſteward vvhich the king <hi>Achab</hi> had, vvhoſe name vvas <hi>Abdias,</hi> the vvhich ſeeing the curſed Queene <hi>Iezabel</hi> cut the throats of the Prophets of Iſrael, did hide ſome number of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vntill all the butchery vvas paſt: the vvhich the good <hi>Abdias</hi> did not ſo much for the loue vvhich hee bore vnto the Prophets, as for the feare vvhich he bore vnto God. When king <hi>Ioſaphat</hi> conſtituted iudges in all the cities of Iudea, he gaue them no other inſtruction, but that they ſhould feare God, and be very mindfull of the good of their Commonwealth, becauſe that by this means they ſhould bee well liked both of God and of all the people. The ſcripture reporteth of holy <hi>Tobias,</hi> that he began at the ſame time to weane his ſon, and fear the God of Iſrael, and that hee contracted friendſhip vvith none nor none vvith him, vnleſſe he knew that he feared God. S. <hi>Ierom</hi> vpon the Prophets ſayth, Al holy men and of great perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doe not only loue the Lord, and feare him as their Lord &amp; God, but doe alſo refuſe to conuerſe vvith thoſe vvhich vvill not fear our Lord: and for that cauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> went from the Caldeans, &amp; holy <hi>Lot</hi> fled from the Sodomites. We muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe &amp; flatter the vertuous man vvith loue, &amp; fear the wicked &amp; peruerſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with threats, becauſe that of tentimes the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man doth rather amend his life for ſeare of hell, than for the deſire vvhich he hath to go to heauen. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily ſaith, That if as God made Paradiſe, he would not haue made alſo an hel, few there vvould haue been, vvhich vvould haue ſerued our Lord, &amp; very many vvhich vvould haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him. Becauſe that if an euil ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might enioy the world, he would little care if heauen vvere taken from him.

O curſed tongue, and wicked ſpeech! what an vngodly mouth was that, which durſt vtter ſuch horrible blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy? for by the rigor of iuſtice, he may iuſtly be caried into hel, who renounceth to go to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and is wel pleaſed to hue in the word. <hi>Anſelmus</hi> ſaith, O what a great fauour God doth vnto that ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God doth not exclude fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his loue, &amp; doth not leaue him without fear for the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which hath both loue and feare in him, although he want other perfections, neither ought to fear, leaſt he ſhould be damned, nor diſtruſt at all to be ſaued. We haue ſpoken all this in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendation of the good theef, &amp; of his piety &amp; charity, who did not rebuke the other theefe his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pamon, for that hee was prowd or enuious, but only becauſe he did not feare God, ſaying <hi>Neque tu times deum,</hi> Neither doeſt thou fear God: Giuing vs to vnderſtand by this, that he went down right into hell, for no other cauſe, but becauſe he made ſmal reckoning of Chriſt. And it is much tobe noted why the good theef did not rebuke the other for that, that he did not loue Chriſt; as he did reprehend him, for that he did not fear Chriſt. <hi>Hilarius</hi> anſwereth this doubt and ſayth, That becauſe loue doth belong vnto thoſe vvhich are perfect, and feare vnto ſuch as are not ſo perfect, the good theefe did not perſuade the other that hee ſhould loue, but that he ſhould feare, becauſe the duty and office of louing, is of ſuch high quality, that although many goe about it, yet few attaine vnto it. Glorious Saint <hi>Peter</hi> did perſuade himſelfe that hee had loued Chriſt, as hee ought to haue loued him; and therevpon to take away his vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, Chriſt asked him three times whether hee loued human which deinand, Chirſt gaue vs to vnderſtand, that the merit of loued oth not conſiſt in louing with all our heart, but if good Ieſus do accept it, that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is perfect. The wil which wee haue to ſerue our Lord, is rather, baſlard will, than a
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:3666:67"/>lawfull will; for to tell the troth, my brother, wee haue more skill in ſinning than in louing. The good theefe would not ſo plainely teach the euill theefe the art of loue, as hee did the duty of feare, partly becauſe the time was too ſhort to learne ſo high a matter, as then being in great torment, and neer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, and partly becauſe the quality of mans mind is eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly induced to feare, and very ſlowly to loue. O vnto how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny may wee ſay now adaies that which the good theefe ſaid vnto the other, that is, neither thou doeſt feare God; letting them to vnderſtand by theſe words, that they neither feare God, nor loue God, nor ſerue God, nor yet remember whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there bee a God, conſidering they let no ſinne vndone, vnleſſe it bee becauſe they dare not, or becauſe they cannot. What friend is there in this world, which giueth his brother ſuch brotherly correction? What friend dare tell his friend, take heed brother, for thou art prowd, or ill-tongued, or a bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler, badly beloued, and euery man marketh thy doings? S. <hi>Barnard</hi> vpon thoſe words of <hi>Ieremy, Omnes amici eius ſpreue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt eum, &amp;c,</hi> ſayth, Woe be vnto me O my good Ieſus, woe be vnto me, becauſe that all the holy maiſters which brought me vp, are now dead, all my faithful friends, which were wont to giue me counſell are now gone; and if I haue any left, they rather couer my faults than correct them. There are few good theeues left to correct mee, and many naughty friends to hide my faults, and (which cannot be ſaid without teares,) which art not content only to hide my ſinnes, but alſo are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to entiſe mee to ſinne. A certaine man of Athens asking <hi>Plato</hi> wherein he ſhould ſhew his friendſhip vnto him, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him; Thou ſhalt aduiſe me of all that I ſhall ſpeak amiſſe, and helpe mee in all that I ſhall doe amiſſe; becauſe the duty which I require of my friend is, that he would helpe mee to be vertuous, and hinder me from being vicious. There are but few friends which doe this, and very few which aske this of their friends: for there are few which will haue thoſe for their friends, which may and will correct them for the enormities they doe, but defend them in the vices they commit. What
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:3666:67"/>doth it auaile me if my friend deliuer mee from my enemies which lay wait for me, if he deliuer me vnto vices which kill me? We ſee that one theefe doth correct another from the croſſe, and yet one Chriſtian will not correct another, but will rather be vicious betwixt themſelues, than breake the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which is betwixt them. <hi>Nonne qui oderunt te domine ode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram, &amp; inimici facti ſunt mihi?</hi> ſaid <hi>Dauid</hi> in the 138 Pſalme: as if hee would ſay, O great God of Iſrael, and mighty Lord of the houſe of <hi>Iacob,</hi> one of the duties which I haue done for thy ſeruice, is, that all the daies of my life I haue hated thoſe which loue not thee, I haue vtterly diſliked thoſe which followed not thee, I went from them which loued not thee, yea I did flie from him which ſerued thee not. <hi>Caſsio dorus</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe words ſayth, Thou haſt great reaſon in that which thou ſaieſt, and greater in that which thou doeſt, O renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and gracious king <hi>Dauide</hi> for if naughty men had no co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions to helpe them, and wanted friends to bandy for them, in ſhort time wee ſhould ſee them ended or amended. That one friend doe not helpe another in matters touching his wealth it may be born, but not to counſell him in things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his conſcience may not be endured: for if the matter doe offend God and endanger our conſcience, we ſhould nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuffer our father who engendred vs, nor yet conſent with friend or brother who loueth vs. <hi>Nathan</hi> did rebuke <hi>Dauid, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel Saul, Micheas Achab, Helias Iezabel,</hi> S. <hi>Iohn Herod,</hi> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> S. <hi>Peter,</hi> not for any thing that they had done againſt themſelues, but for that which they had committed againſt God: becauſe we ſhould know that we ought to hold him for an enemy, who is not beloued of God. How wilt thou haue God for thy Lord and friend, if thou bee a friend vnto that that he deteſteth? We haue great need to ſay with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. Did I not hate thoſe which did hate thee, and they are become my enemies? For to tell thee the truth, my brother; thou canſt neues rightly Ioue vertue and vertuous men, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe thou doe firſt deteſt vice and vicious men. For as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayth, Hee ſhall neuer or very late bee good, who will haue a
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:3666:68"/>naughty man for his friend. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayth, What greater maruails wouldeſt thou ſee or heare, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe which the ſonne of God did at his death, where preachers became theeues, &amp; theeues turned to be preachers? Wicked <hi>Iudas</hi> was a preacher, and he became a theefe; and hee who ſuffered with Chriſt was a theefe, and he became a preacher: and as they tooke new offices, ſo they ended in diuers effects; for the one ſold Chriſt in the temple, and the other excuſed Chriſt vpon the croſſe. Who was the laſt theefe of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, and the firſt preacher in the church, but that holy theefe which ſuffered by Chriſt? Who made a Sermon of greater weight than this theefe did, conſidering that in the preſence of all men, and againſt them all he accuſed himſelfe and excuſed Chriſt? <hi>Hic autem quid malifecit?</hi> Theſe are the words, not of a Pagan, but of a Chriſtian: as if he would haue ſaid, Who euer being God made himſelfe a man, eternall made himſelfe temporall, &amp; being infinite limited his power, and being a iudge ſuffered himſelfe to bee iudged? What hurt did he; Who taught thoſe which knew little, who ſet thoſe aright which went aſtray; who did comfort thoſe which wept, &amp; who did pardon thoſe which did offend. What hurt did he; He who did reſtore the deafe vnto their hearing, fed the hungry, gaue ſight vnto the blind, and raiſed the dead to life? What hurt did he; He who preached vnto the Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane woman, defended the woman taken in adultery, and hee who helped the Cananean, and forgaue <hi>Mary Magdalen?</hi> What hurt did he; Hee who preached the faith, taught the law, opened the Prophets, and hee who put vp a ſchoole throughout all the world? <hi>Quid mali fecit,</hi> what harme had he done. He who made vs a path-way to walk in, a truth to hold by, a life to liue by, and glory for vs to enioy? What hurt did he; He who endured hunger, becauſe I might eat, took great iournies becauſe I ſhould take reſt, and who ſuffered becauſe I ſhould not bee endangered, and hee who died becauſe I ſhould liue. What hurt did he? O curſed Iſraelites, O forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Iewes, what hurt hath hee done vnto your Synagogue,

The good theefe did not only excuſe Chriſt, and intreat for him, but did alſo accuſe himſelfe, ſaying, <hi>Nos quidem inſtè patimur:</hi> as if hee would ſay, Thou and I, I and thou, my companion, if we ſuffer any thing, wee ſuffer it worthily, becauſe they haue giuen vs our torment according to our offence. There are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few which make a more glorious confeſsion than this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſo much againſt our nature to ſuffer a reproch, that we will rather ſuffer torment than confeſſe our fault.

Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Angel rebuked the children of Iſrael in Galgalos, they did preſently break down their Idols, cloth themſelues with fackclothes: by reaſon whereof when the Lord ſaw that they began to confeſſe their fault, and not excuſe it, hee did not only pardon them, but did alſo comfort them.

When <hi>Achab</hi> the murderer was rebuked by the Prophet <hi>Helias</hi> for ſtoning <hi>Naboth</hi> to death, becauſe hee denied him his Vineyard, hee wept immediately and faſted, &amp; repented him of that which he had done, and therfore he was abſolued of his fault before the Prophet went out of the threſhold of his dore. Who euer hath confeſſed with his heart, which hath not ben pardoned at Gods hands? Why doeſt thou thinke that the theefe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained pardon ſo quickly at Gods hands, but becauſe hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed Chriſt, inſtructed his fellow, and accuſed himſelf? This was a glorious confeſsion, and a fault worthy of pardon, ſeeing that on the Mount of Caluary, and not in the Temple, vpon the tree &amp; not in place of confeſsion, publickly &amp; not ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, aloud and not in muttering wiſe, hee confeſſed the ſonne of God to be our redeemer, and himſelfe a ſinner. O holy theef (ſaith <hi>Chriſostome</hi>) Why doeſt thou not ask that they would vnloſe the cords which thou art bound with, or pull out the nailes which thou art nailed with, or looke vnto thy houſe &amp; family, becauſe thou art now going out of this world, or that they would bury thy ſorrowfull body? Truly that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to bee an exceeding great loue which thou didſt beare vnto Chriſt, ſeeing thou diddeſt forget thy ſelfe, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber him, excuſe his innocency, &amp; proclaime thine own offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

For if our faults were put in a ballance on one ſide, and our puniſhment on the other, without compariſon our Lord doth diſſemble much more than hee doth puniſh.

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:3666:70"/>thankleſſe and an vngratefull man.

There is no ſuch great difference betwixt torturers and theeues, and theeues and torturers, that the one ſhould be heard, and the other repulſed: for if torturers and hangmen take their liues from ſuch as are hanged, ſo doe great theeues alſo take away mens riches and apparell by the high way. The wicked Iewes did not deſerue an anſwere at Chriſts hands, ſeeing they ſaid, come downe from the croſſe; becauſe no man ſhould bee ſo bold as to bid him come downe, but goe vp: becauſe ſuch as are to goe into hell, goe downe, and thoſe which are to go to heauen goe vpward.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:3666:73"/>he ſhould deliuer them from the croſſes, and put them in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in a ſermon ſayth thus, According vnto the great loue, that Chriſt died with, &amp; according vnto the great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of bloud which iſſued out of his body, it had been but a ſmall enterpriſe for Chriſt to haue looſed the theefe, &amp; haue ſent him to keepe his Eaſter in his owne houſe, becauſe hee came not into the world to ſet theeues at liberty, but to ſaue ſinners. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſayth, That if as that naughty theefe did ask Chriſt that hee would pull out thoſe nailes, and ſlacken thoſe cords, and deliuer him from thoſe torturers, and aſſwage his torments, he would haue asked ſomewhat touching his ſoule, or that he would haue had mercy ſhewed vpon him, our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Lord would not haue refuſed to anſwere him to that which hee ſaid, nor haue denied him that which hee deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. O what a theefe hee is (ſayth <hi>Haymo</hi>) and a theeues fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, who can aske nothing of Chriſt, but honour to get him credite, power to defend himſelf, and might to offend others, riches to enioy, liberty to command, and health to liue onely in this world! Such as dare to aske theſe things of our Lord, be either Chriſtians without ſouls, or theeues without ſhame, of whom I doe now prophecy, that if they bee not hanged like theeues, they ſhall bee condemned like ſinners. Let vs take example by this dreadfulll example, that wee doe not aske with the naughty theefe, that our Lord would take vs from the croſſe, but that hee would keepe vs on the croſſe; nor let vs not aske of him that hee would giue vs a long life, but that he would amend our conſciences. For look how willing our Lord is, to giue vs things neceſſary to ſaue vs, ſo is hee vnwilling to giue vs that which wee doe aske of him to cocker vs.</p>

There was in the ſame citie a widdow named <hi>Iudith,</hi> who was beautifull in her countenance, chaſt in her body, rich in eſtate, and of great fame and credite among the people. This holy <hi>Iudith</hi> perceiuing that the captains of the city were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maied on one ſide, and the neighbors diſpaired on the other, ſaid vnto them as followeth: Who are you which dare tempt the great God of Iſrael, and will giue your ſelues to be ſlaues, if he do not deliuer you from the Aſſyrians within fiue daies? Wil you preſcribe fiue daies to the infinit mercy of the Lord, who hath neither beginning nor ending? Doe you not know that ſuch a promiſe and vow made againſt our Lord, doth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtirre him to indignation, than appeaſe his anger? Care not then to load your ſelues with armes, but with larmes: care
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:3666:74"/>you not to make prouiſion of victuals, but to weepe for your ſinnes: becauſe you ſhould be more afraid of your ſins, than of your enemies. The warre which you endure, and the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which you ſuffer, the God of heauen, and not <hi>Holofernes</hi> maketh againſt you, and with no other weapons but with your owne offences: and you muſt learne, that the enemies who beſiege you, are rather executioners of Gods diuine iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, than enemies of your Commonwealth. All the time that our forefathers were at peace with our Lord, they did well; and when they neglected their duty vnto him, it went not well with them: and as it fared then with them, ſo doth it now with vs; in ſo much that all our paines and trauels come from the hands of God, either to puniſh vs, or for to make vs merit. Tell me (ſaith <hi>Dauid</hi>) what are wee able to doe, what are we able to performe, or what doe wee know if we bee not guided by the hand of God? If the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our ableneſſe muſt come from God to doe any thing, and our ſtrength from him to be able to performe any thing, and our knowledge from him if we will gueſſe aright at any thing, in whoſe hands ſhould wee put our hope, but in the hands of his diuine mercy? Let it bee ſo then, that there bee a proclamation made throughout all Bethulia, that the old men faſt, the yong me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> giue themſelues diſcipline, the Prieſts pray, and all weepe together, that it would pleaſe God to keepe and deliuer not the wals from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, but our hearts from ſinnes. All the citizens were very much amazed at that that holy <hi>Iudith</hi> counſelled them, and all accepted her counſell, by reaſon wherof, within fiue daies <hi>Holofernes</hi> was beheaded, he and his defeated, the city vnbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, and the countrey pacified. To returne then fitly vnto our purpoſe, agreeablie vnto this aduiſe our theefe behaued himſelfe on the croſſe with Chriſt: for firſt, he deſired our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of the world to forgiue him his ſinnes, before hee as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him that it would pleaſe him to take him with him vnto the kingdome of heauen. This theef did not ſay vnto Chriſt, When thou commeſt into thy kingdome, Lord remember me, for ſo hee might haue ſeemed to aske for heauen before
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:3666:74"/>he had asked for the remiſsion of ſinnes; but he ſaid <hi>Domine memento mei,</hi> Lord remember me when thou ſhalt come into thy kingdome. In which words hee firſt made his confeſsion, and then formed his petition. What doth it auaile thee to ask of Chriſt, if hee bee angry with thee: firſt make Chriſt thy friend, then aske fauour at his hands. For it is the manner and condition of our Lord, that firſt thou giue thy ſelfe vnto him, and then for him to giue himſelfe vnto thee. <hi>Vbertinus</hi> ſayth, That it is greatly to bee noted, that the good theefe did not ſay vnto Chriſt, take me from this croſſe, help to vnlooſe me, giue me life, reſtore my credite; but hee ſaid, Lord remember me, ſeeing that thou knoweſt better what to giue me, than I. to aske of thee. S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> vpon S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſayth, That this theefe was very happy and glorious, ſeeing hee taught the church how to pray, as he had taught the Synagogue how to ſteale, conſidering he ſaid nothing in his petition, but Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member mee: the which praier although it were ſhort, yet it was full of myſtery, becauſe that we need not to be very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate with God to win his fauour, but remember him of our buſines with <hi>Domine memento mei.</hi> What ſaieſt thou good theefe, what ſaieſt thou? <hi>Domine memento mei dum veneris in regnum tuum:</hi> as if he would ſay, O holy Prophet, O Ieſus of Galily, by the bloud which thou ſheddeſt, I beſeech thee, &amp; by the loue with the which thou diddeſt ſhed it, I pray thee, that thou wouldeſt be mindfull of me, when thou ſhalt come into thy owne proper kingdome. If wee will reckon the fiue words, they are theſe: <hi>Domine</hi> the firſt, <hi>memento</hi> the ſecond, <hi>mei</hi> the third, <hi>dum veneris</hi> the fourth, <hi>in regnum tuum</hi> the fift. Now it is to be noted, who ſpake theſe words, that is a theefe, vnto whom he ſpake them, which was Chriſt, where he ſpake them, which was vpon the croſſe, and when hee ſpake them, and it was when hee was ready to die: inſomuch that if they be eaſie to be counted, they are hard to be vnderſtood. Hee dooth begin his praier like a curious Orator with this word <hi>Domine,</hi> Lord, wherein it ſeemeth that hee dooth confeſſe in Chriſt, his Deity and diuinity, his eſſence and power, his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:3666:75"/>and rule, his iuſtice and liberality. <hi>Origen</hi> ſayth, If the good theefe ſhould beleeue that Chriſt was a mighty and great king, yet would he aske him no leſſe than a whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? This word Lord is a high beginning of a petition: for if he who asketh do not beleeue that all things are vnder his mighty hand, he could not thinke that he ſhould obtaine any thing. O glorious theefe (ſayth <hi>Anſelmus</hi>) and happy martyr, what doeſt thou ſee in this Lord which is crucified, what doſt thou ſee in him on the croſſe, why thou ſhouldeſt commend thy ſelfe vnto him? Who euer ſaw or heard the like, that one which was bound ſhould commend himſelfe vnto another, which was alſo bound; and one which was crucified vnto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame caſe? Doeſt thou aske that thoſe confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies and friendſhips which end in death, ſhould begin with Chriſt and thee in death? Seeing hee who ſhould be a Lord, ſhould bee at liberty and in freedome, why doeſt thou call him Lord, which is faſtened to the croſſe, and crucified like thy ſelfe? Seeing that he who ſhould be a Lord, ought to bee mighty and rich, why doeſt thou call him Lord, who was poor in his life time, and naked in his death? But this Prophet who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I call vpon, and vnto whome I commend and commit my ſelfe, is a mighty Lord, and a king of great power, ſeeing the ſon loſt his light for compaſsion, the ſtones broke with griefe, the vaile rent in ſunder for a myſtery, the graues opened with feare, and the Centurion confeſſed him to be Chriſt. O great God of Iſrael, O great Lord of the houſe of <hi>Iacob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>,</hi> for this cauſe thy name is admirable, and worſhipped in all the circuit of the earth, becauſe thy power and dominion is doubled and redoubled, more than any mans in the world. <hi>Caſsiodorus</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vpon this matter, That the holy ſcripture doth neuer call any twiſe Lord, Lord, but Chriſt alone; becauſe he alone, and none with him, is Lord of heauen and earth, of life and death, body and ſoule, and of peace and warre. Wee cannot call <hi>Hector</hi> the Troian, <hi>Anchiſes</hi> the Grecian, <hi>Alexander</hi> the Macedonian, and <hi>Caeſar</hi> the Romane, Lord, more than once, becauſe they were kings onely of their owne kingdomes: but
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:3666:75"/>vnto the ſonne of God, wee ſay twiſe <hi>Domine domine noſter,</hi> Lord our Lord, becauſe his ſiegnory is ſo great, that no man is able to limit it, nor ſet any bonds vnto it. Euery other Prince hath his kingdome limited and ſet with bonds, either to the top of a ſteeple or couering of a houſe; and if it bee not ſo, let him ſend a poſt from thence vpward, and hee ſhall perceiue that his kingdome reacheth no higher: which cannot be ſaid to be true of the ſonne of Gods Empire, ſeeing it goeth from one end of the world vntill the other, and reacheth vp vnto the higheſt heauen. Conſidering that <hi>Dauid</hi> calleth Chriſt, Lord Lord twiſe, why doth he call him only once Lord. The myſtery of this myſtery is, that <hi>Dauid</hi> called him Lord, Lord twiſe, becauſe hee ſhould keepe his body from his enemies, and cary his ſoule vnto thoſe which are bleſſed: but the good theefe did call him but once Lord, becauſe his intention was not that Chriſt ſhould keepe his life, but only that hee would vouchſafe to ſaue his ſoule. Why doeſt thou thinke (ſayth S. <hi>Baſil</hi> vpon the Pſalme) that <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaid vnto our Lord, Lord calling him twife Lord, but becauſe he was Lord of the truth, and of the figure, of the church and of the ſynagogue, of the Prophets and of the Apoſtles, and of the old Teſtament and of the new? The good theefe would not call Chriſt Lord twiſe, becauſe hee would let vs vnderſtand, that the figure is fulfilled, and the truth come; that the church is come and the ſynagogue ended; that the Prophets are dead, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſucceeded in their place; that the old law is buried, and the Goſpel proclaimed. Why, think you, doth the good theef call Chriſt Lord but once, but becauſe we haue but one Lord to beleeue, &amp; one redeemer to worſhip? To ſay once Chriſt remember me, was to ſay, that hee would haue him and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for a maſter to ſerue, for God in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he would beleeue, for his Lord whom hee would obey, for a friend whome hee would truſt vnto, &amp; for an aduocate in whoſe hands he would put himſelfe into. The ſecond word which the theefe ſaid vnto Chriſt was Reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber me: as if he would ſay, Seeing that I doe confeſſe thee here before all men to bee my Lord, and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:3666:76"/>vpon this croſſe acknowledge thee to be my redeemer, haue mee in remembrance, my good Lord, ſeeing I haue reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred thee, and turned vnto thee. Remember me O ſweet Ieſus: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou haſt created me, remember me; ſeeing thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed mee, remember mee; and ſeeing thou haſt lightened me, remember mee; and ſeeing thou haſt choſen me, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me: for it would auaile me very little, that thou ſhouldeſt giue me light to know thee, if withall thou ſhouldeſt not giue me grace to ſerue thee. Reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber me O good Ieſus, becauſe I am hard by thy ſide, remember me becauſe I beleeue in thee, remember me becauſe I truſt in thee, remember me becauſe I hope in none but in thee; and ſeeing I haue offered my ſelfe for to be thy perpetuall ſeruant, remember I beſeech thee to accept me for thine. Remember mee becauſe thou haſt raiſed me from the duſt, remember me becauſe thou haſt made me a Chriſtian, remember me to make mee good, and remember mee to giue mee heauen, and aboue all things I beſeech thee that ſeeing thou haſt giuen thy life for me, remember me that I loſe not my ſoule. O good Ieſus giuer of life, with my tongue I beſeech thee, and with my heart I aske it of thee, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou doeſt ſhed thy precious bloud vpon the croſſe for me, remember me that it be not euilly beſtowed on mee: and when ſhall thy bloud be euilly beſtowed on mee, but when it is not by thee accepted for me? Seeing thou haſt ſweat oft for me, ſuffered moſt grieuous pains for me, endured inſpeakable perſecutions for mee, and haſt diſſembled my abominable of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences; what doeſt thou gaine O good Ieſus, what doeſt thou gaine, if I loſe my ſoule, and thou the fruit of thy precious bloud? Remember me O Lord, ſeeing that in pardoning my fault, and by ſauing my ſoul, thou ſhalt make a Chriſtian, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple heauen the more, enrich thy church, ſpread abroad thy fame, and exalt thy mercy.

I dy for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a theefe, and thou for the ſame cauſe; they put mee to death on the Mount of Caluary, and on the Mount of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uary they kill thee, at high noone daies they execute mee, and at the ſame houre they execute thee, thou art as neere the end of thy life, as I am neere to death; and therfore Lord remember me: thus as wee depart both together out of this world ſo alſo we may both together goe into heauen. What reaſon doth permit it, or what iuſtice doth ſuffer, O my good Lord, that thou ſhouldeſt take me for thy companion, to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer on the croſſe with thee; and when thou doeſt go into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, to leaue mee here behind thee? Seeing thou wilt depart out of this world to death, and that through ſuch a narrow paſſage and long way, whom canſt thou take with thee better than the theefe, which was thy fellow vpon the tree? It is neceſſary that thy poore mother liue, thou haſt left thy <hi>Iohn</hi> thy couſin to his owne cuſtodie, <hi>Peter</hi> thy Diſciple hath denied thee, <hi>Iudas</hi> thy ſteward hath ſold thee, all the Iewes haue beene vngratefull vnto thee; and therfore ſeeing

Seeing that of old time, thou art accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to forgiue very famous theeues, and diſſemble very notorious thefts, why doeſt thou not forgiue me among them, and abſolue me of my ſinnes? If thou wilt haue tears for the thefts which I haue done, thou ſeeſt that they run downe my cheekes; if thou doeſt content thy ſelfe to ſee bloud, thou ſeeſt that there is no drop left in mee, if thou wilt haue mee whip my ſelfe, I am already bowelled, if thou wilt haue mee repent, I ſay vnto thee <hi>Soli peccaui,</hi> if thou wilt haue mee make entire ſatisfaction, how canſt thou haue me to do it, not

Lord Ieſus remember mee, and bee my ſurety vnto thy father in the other world, and put mee with thy choſen flocke, write mee in thy booke, and place mee in thy glory, ſeeing that the faith of which thou art, doth flouriſh onely in thy mother, and remaineth in my heart. Remember mee O good Ieſus, and if thou wilt depart out of this ſorrowfull life into the other before mee, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, leaue mee the ſtep of thy foor to tread in, and a path-way to follow thee: for if I acknowledge thee for my God, and receaue thee for my God, and beleeue in thee for my God, being as thou art diſmembred and crucified, ſhall not I ſerue thee, and praiſe thee farre better when I ſhall ſee thee glorified? Dareſt thou truſt me with thy croſſe, becauſe I ſhould worſhip it, and with thy body becauſe I ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company thee, and with thy mother to comfort her, and with thy honour to defend it, and with thy church to augment it, and with thy faith to maintaine it, and wilt thou not put thy glory into my hands, that I may alwaies praiſe thee in it? When they condemned thee to bee crucified, and brought mee to bee executed, I heard thee ſay there before <hi>Pilate,</hi> That thy kingdome was not of this world: and then ſeeing thou art a king, and haſt a kingdome, remember mee and take me with thee, and I will tell thy father what thou haſt ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſerue him, and all the fauours which thou haſt done for me. Now that the good theefe hath made his praier vnto God, and recommended himſelfe vnto him, it is reaſon now that the naughty theefe haue licenſe to ſpeake, which is my naughty and peruerſe heart; becauſe the theefe which han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on the left hand of God, did blaſpheme Chriſt but once, but thou, my ſoule, doeſt blaſpheme him euery day.

The Patriarch <hi>Abraham</hi> had a baſtard child by <hi>Agar</hi> his maid and ſlaue, both which were throwne out of dores after that hee had a lawfull child borne vnto him, and theſe two went vp a mountaine alone in great diſpaire, &amp; our Lord ſent vnto them an Angel to comfort them, and to giue them drinke. <hi>Origen</hi> ſayth, That if wee looke well into the ſcripture, we ſhall neither read, that the mother did pray vnto the Lord, neither is it made mention that the ſonne did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend himſelfe vnto God: but that Gods great mercy is ſo great, that by ſeeing the youth <hi>Iſmael</hi> weepe, and the ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mother lament and cry, our Lord was moued to comfort them by word, and alſo releiue them in deed. <hi>Plato</hi> in his Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mao ſayth, That it doth ſmally benefit the grieued and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſſe to viſit them ſeldome, and ſpeake much vnto them, and giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no comfort at all, vnleſſe that comfort be wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in ſome remedie and reliefe. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayth, That if a friend doe viſite his friend, and find him heauy and ſad, and ſo leaue him, if hee find him poore and ſo leaue him, if hee find him weeping, and leaue him weeping, wee will ſay of ſuch a one, that hee goeth rather to ieſt, than to viſite and comfort: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a comfortleſſe heart, is much better appeaſed with that
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:3666:79"/>which we giue him with our hands, than with that which we ſpeake vnto him with our tongue. S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his <hi>Exame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> ſayth, That to the end a worke of mercy may bee perfect &amp; more acceptable vnto our Lord, it ought neither to bee as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of any, nor craued, but voluntarily &amp; liberally be beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe there is nothing more deare in this world, than that which is bought with entreaty. O that hee buieth very deerely, who buieth by the change and price of his ſhame; becauſe that ſhamefaſt men and of liberall hearts, doe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out compariſon grieue more when they vncouer &amp; ſhew their face, than when they vntie their purſe. <hi>Cicero</hi> to <hi>Atticus</hi> ſayth, That there is nothing wherein a Gentlemanlike man taketh more delight than in giuing, and greater griefe than in asking; becauſe that in giuing, he maketh himſelf Lord of him vnto whome hee giueth, and in taking hee maketh himſelfe a ſlaue to him of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he receiueth. <hi>Hilarius</hi> ſaith, That to deale with God, there need no words but teares, nor many entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties but many ſighes: for whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we pray vnto our Lord, he hath greater regard vnto the heart which deſireth, than vnto all that which the tongue ſpeaketh. <hi>Agar</hi> the ſlaue, and <hi>Iſmael</hi> her ſonne, ſpake no word vnto God, nor yet made any petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto him, but ech of them being ſet downe vnder a ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall oke, the ſonne did neuer fill himſelfe with weeping, and the mother neuer ceaſſed from ſighing, the which holy teares were not vnpaied, nor ſighes vnaccepted. To come then vnto our purpoſe, if our Lord did heare <hi>Iſmaels</hi> teares, which was in the deſart, will he not alſo hear the <hi>memento mei,</hi> which the theefe ſpake vnto him in the Mount of Caluary? Let no man maruell that we compare the theefe with <hi>Iſmael,</hi> and <hi>Iſmael</hi> with the theefe: for as the one was brought vp in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines a hunting, ſo the other went by the high waies a rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing, &amp; as <hi>Iſmael</hi> had one very vertuous brother, ſo alſo this theefe had a blaſphemer to his companion. <hi>Iſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ael</hi> was yong, for hee was not aboue three yeares of age, the theefe was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo yong, for he had not been as yet three houres a Chriſtian, becauſe that before our Lord, the yeares when we are borne,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:3666:79"/>are not reckoned, but the time from whence we are baptized. After Chriſts reſurrection, hee called his diſciples children and yonglings, not reſpecting that ſome of them were old, and had gray haires, but that they had not ben long baptized, that is, when hee waſhed their feet in the parlar, and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them Prieſts after his ſupper. If <hi>Iſmael</hi> did weepe at the foot of the oake in the deſart, ſo did the good theefe weepe alſo vpon the croſſe on Caluary: and that which is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent is, that if hee gaue the one water whereof hee ſhould drinke, he gaue the other his bloud, wherewith he ſhould bee ſaued. As <hi>Abraham</hi> had one lawfull child, which was <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and another a baſtard which was <hi>Iſmael,</hi> ſo God the father had or lawfull child, which was Chriſt, and the other a ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard, which was the theefe; and of theſe two, the one was borne in the church, and the other in the Synagogue. The bleſsing which fell vnto <hi>Iſmael,</hi> was that he ſhould be againſt all men and all men againſt him: the which bleſsing alſo the good theefe had, who being vpon the croſſe, and all purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to kill and crucifie Chriſt, hee againſt all [though all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him] defended him and excuſed him. <hi>Iſmael</hi> was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of many barbarous people, and the good theefe was an example of many great ſinners, but not that they ſhould liue wickedly as hee had done, but that they ſhould turne vnto our Lord as hee did. <hi>Agar</hi> the mother could not ſee <hi>Iſmael</hi> her ſonne die, neither could the ſonne of God ſee his companion the theefe bee condemned: and therefore as the teares of the one were gratefull vnto him, euen ſo the words of the other vvere pleaſing vnto him; to wit, when hee ſaid on the croſſe, Lord remember me, and O good Ieſus haue mercy vpon mee. With great reaſon, and for good occaſion the ſon of God did giue care vnto all that the good theefe would ſpeake vnto him, and vnto all that which hee did requeſt of him, becauſe hee vſed ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and diſcretion in his petition, that hee asked nothing which ſhould bee for his comfort, but for his ſaluation. If hee vvould haue asked any thing for his comfort, he vvould
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:3666:80"/>haue asked that the cudgels which winded his cords ſhould haue been ſlackened, or that they would haue pulled out the nailes, or healed his wounds, or that they would pull him downe from the croſſe, or that they would giue him longer life: but he asked none of all this, but only that Chriſt would haue his ſoule in remembrance, not mentioning his perſon at all. Our Lord could not denie him ſo reaſonable a petition, nor delay him, but he anſwered him immediately: for euen as he ſaid, <hi>Domine memento moi,</hi> Chriſt ſaid preſently vnto him, <hi>Hodie mecum eris in Paradiſo,</hi> This day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe. The naughty theefe did not deſerue to haue an anſwere at Chriſts hands neither ſoon nor late, partly becauſe it was the ſonne of Gods cuſtome, not to anſwer thoſe which did iniury him, nor eſteeme of thoſe which bare falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe againſt him, and partly to aduiſe vs, that it is a point of great diſcretion, not to ſet by iniurious words. <hi>Vbertinus</hi> ſaith, Why ſhould Chriſt heare what the naughty theefe would aske him, or make account of it, ſeeing that he knew very wel that if he would haue beene looſed, it was to ſteale againe, and in ſtealing againe, they would hang him againe? In that that Chriſt would not anſwere vnto the naughty theefe, nor yeeld vnto his petition, hee vſed a new kind of clemency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him; to wit, that he hindered him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſinning any more, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> augmenting his damnation: for if Chriſt ſhould haue taken him from the croſſe, and hee haue returned againe into the world, by how much the more he would haue augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted his ſinne, by ſo much the more he ſhould haue encreaſed his puniſhment. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayth, That our Lord ſhewed his mercy and pity toward both the theeues; vnto the good one in giuing him glory, to the naughty one in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying him life: for if he had liued longer, he would haue ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned more, and according to the meaſure of his offences, his torments ſhould haue beene giuen him. S. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, That if our Lord doe for vs that which wee aske, wee ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioice; and if he deny vs that which wee aske him, wee muſt not complaine: for if our Lord would haue giuen the ſonnes
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:3666:80"/>of <hi>Zebedet</hi> the kingdome which they required, and vnto the naughty theefe the life which hee craued, it had beene vnto their great confuſion and alſo damnation. And becauſe that in theſe words, <hi>Hodie mecum eris in Paradiſo,</hi> there are contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſeuen words, as we haue noted heretofore; it ſhall not bee amiſſe, if that vpon euery word we ſpeake one word, becauſe the curious Reader may ſee how wiſely the theefe dealt, and how profoundly Chriſt did anſwer him. The firſt word which Chriſt ſpake vnto the theefe was <hi>Amen,</hi> that is, I ſweare to thee in truth: which word <hi>Amen</hi> was in the old Teſtament very famous, and much ſet by, and in the mouth of the ſonne of God much vſed, inſomuch that the Synagogue did profit herſelfe with that word to confirme that which ſhe ſware, &amp; Chriſt vſed the ſame word to ſweare that which he ſpake. <hi>In monte Hebal ſtabunt, Ruben, Gad, Aſser, Zabulon, Dan &amp; Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalim, ad maledice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

When the ſix prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were come to the top of the hill Hebal, they began to curſe thoſe which brake the law in this manner. Accurſed be that man which dare make ſtrange Gods to worſhip and giue honour vnto them, although they be of gold and ſiluer, &amp; let all the people ſay Amen. Curſed bee the ſonne or daughter which will not honour his father and his mother, and let all men ſay Amen. Curſed bee that man which ieſting at a blind man, ſhall put his foot before him to make him fall, and ſhall ſet him out of the way to make him erre, and let all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſay Amen. Curſed be the man which will take money to kill his neighbour by treaſon and craft, and let all ſay Amen. Curſed bee the iudge, who either through hatred or gaine which hee may pretend, giueth a wrong iudgement againſt a
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:3666:81"/>widdow, and oppreſſe the orphane, and not eaſe a ſtranger, and let all the people ſay Amen. You may then ſee that this word <hi>Amen</hi> was a word of feare and of great rigour, ſeeing that it was vſed to confirme their curſes, which they did caſt vpon the people, and not the bleſsings which they gaue them. It is to bee noted, that God commanded <hi>Moyſes</hi> the ſame day to goe vp vnto the top of the hill Gariſim with ſix Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with him, to bleſſe all thoſe which would keepe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: but hee did not command them in the end of their bleſsing to ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> as hee did in the end of his curſe. The ſynagogue was not worthy of this priuiledge, becauſe God kept it for his church, which is ſeene by the promiſe which Chriſt made vnto the good theefe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaid, Amen I ſay vnto thee this day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe, in ſo much that Chriſt began to bleſſe the choſen of his church, with the ſame word that the ſynagogue ended her curſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the tranſgreſſors of the law. This word <hi>Amen</hi> (ſayth <hi>Vbertinus</hi>) which did ſerue in the ſynagogue for a curſe, doth ſerue now in the vniuerſall Church for a bleſsing: the which word the ſonne of God had alwaies in his mouth, when hee promiſed any great matter, or ſpake any high ſecret. Chriſt did ſo well like this word <hi>Amen,</hi> truly, that his Euangeliſts and Chroniclers doe affirme, that hee vſed it fifty and fiue times, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtles eighteen times, and it is vſed in the Apocalips alſo fiue times, and in the canonicall Epiſtle three times. S. <hi>Auguſt,</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, That the ſonne of God was not content to ſay once Amen, but he did ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>times double the word, ſaying <hi>Amen, Amen,</hi> truly, truly; giuing vs thereby to vnderſtand, that he did not only ſpeake the truth in that which he ſpake, but alſo that he was the truth it ſelfe. There is no Angell nor man (ſaith <hi>Remigius</hi>) which can ſay <hi>Amen, Amen:</hi> for although they ſpeake the truth in all that they ſpeake, yet it doth not follow that they be the truth it ſelfe, becauſe God did not impart this high priuiledge vnto any, but his onely ſonne, who by ſpeciall grace ſaid, <hi>Ego ſum via &amp; veritas &amp; vita,</hi> I am the way and the truth and life.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:3666:81"/>Chriſt did not ſay, I know which way the way goeth, but ſaid I am the way: for in troth he who is not guided by Chriſt ſhal miſſe the way to heauen. Nor Chriſt ſaid not, I giue life, but ſaid I am the life, becauſe that in the houſe of God, they call it not to liue, vnleſſe they liue well, neither doe they ſay that man to liue, which is not a good man; nor Chirſt did not ſay, I ſpeake the truth in that which I ſay, but ſaid I am the very truth: for euen as the deuill is a bottome without bottome, from whence all lies doe proceed, ſo the ſonne of God is a fountaine from whence all truths doe ſpring. <hi>Benedictio &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor &amp; gloria, &amp; poteſtas in ſecula ſeculorum, &amp; quatuor anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia dicebant Amen,</hi> Apocalips 5. ſaid the Angels in praiſe of our Lord: as if they would ſay, Let honour, glory, power and bleſsing, be giuen vnto our God, and vnto the lambe his ſon, for euer and euer, and the foure beaſts anſwered <hi>Amen.</hi> Alſo S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaid in the 7. chapter, That he ſaw a company of Saints before God, which were ſo many in number, that they could not bee numbred, and ſo many Angels alſo that they could not be numbred, clothed with ſtoles &amp; palmes in their hands and proſtrate vpon the ground, which ſaid no other thing in the praiſe of God but Amen, Amen, Amen. O what great myſteries and deepe ſecrets are contained vnder this holy word Amen, ſeeing we find it in the old Teſtament, and that Chriſt vſed it, and the Angels in heauen praiſe Chriſt with it, and the church alſo doth euery vvhere profite her ſelfe vvith it! Doth ſhee not profite her ſelfe vvith it, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that in the end of euery praier, ſhee doth confirme it with Amen? Vnto World without end, we anſwere Amen, vnto Who liueth and raigneth, vve anſwer Amen: vvith this holy vvord the ſonne of God began to pardon, and vvith the ſame vvord the church endeth her praier. <hi>Rupert</hi> vpon the Apocalips ſaith, That this vvord Ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is neither Greek, nor Latine, nor Chaldey, but Hebrew: and although this word might haue beene turned as other vvordes vvere, yet the church did not thinke it conuenient, but as Chriſt ſaid A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſo doth the church ſay likewiſe Amen. Why did the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:3666:82"/>ſon of God (ſaith <hi>Chriſoſt.</hi>) begin the pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which he gaue the good theefe, with this word <hi>Amen dico tibi,</hi> but only to aſſure him, that he would fulfill all which he promiſed him? Seeing that it is a cuſtome firſt to promiſe that which wee will giue or do, and then to ſweare and affirme it, why did the ſonne of God do the contrary, &amp; ſwear before he promiſed the theefe Paradiſe? For when Chriſt ſaid vnto the theefe, <hi>Amen dico ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi,</hi> it was as much as to ſay, I ſweare in truth: and why would God ſwear that which he promiſed, and would not be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at his word? <hi>Cyprian</hi> vpon the Paſsion ſaith, That becauſe that which Chriſt promiſed was ſuch a great matter, to wit Paradiſe, and he vnto whom he promiſed ſuch a grieuous ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who was a theefe, &amp; he who promiſed, of ſuch ſmall cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, who was a man crucified, and the place where he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo infamous which was the croſſe, and the people before whom he promiſed ſo vile, who were the Iewes, the ſonne of God would ſwear firſt before he promiſed. If Chriſt did ſwear it was not becauſe there was any want in his word, but becauſe the ſynagogue ſhould the better beleeue him. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, That if the ſon of God would not haue ſworn the performance of ſo great a gift, it would haue ſeemed vnto the Iewes, that he had promiſed it him in a mockage; &amp; ſo much the rather, becauſe that vntil that very inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, in which Chriſt ſaid on the croſſe, <hi>Hodie mecum eris in Paradiſe,</hi> he neuer gaue it vnto Saint, nor promiſed it in ſcripture. If Chriſt had not ſworn that which he promiſed, who would not haue thought that he had ieſted in promiſing credit &amp; honor vnto him who had loſt his credit, to promiſe life vnto him who was dead, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty vnto him who was bound, riches vnto him who was poore, and glory vnto him who was infamous? Becauſe the Iewes obſtinacy was ſo great, and the good theeues faith but yong and weake, good Ieſus would ſweare before hee promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that which he meant to promiſe; &amp; becauſe al men might be certain, that he who at the point of death, confirmed any thing by oth, ought neuer to deceiue.</p>

All out friends and counſellors, when they doe aduertiſe vs of any thing, doe ſeeme rather to goe by gueſſe, than bee ſure of that which they ſay: and by that means they giue vs counſell after we haue receiued hurt, and teach vs the way after that wee haue gone aſtray.

O how true it is (ſaith <hi>Origen</hi>) when our
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:3666:83"/>Lord ſaith that hee ſpeaketh nothing but that which is iuſt, and teacheth nothing but that which is right, ſeeing hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth thoſe iuſt who deale with him, and maketh thoſe holy who doe conuerſe with him. And if he ſay that the obſtinate men and naughty be his, yet he will not ſay, that hee is one of their number. What can the children of vanity tell vs but vain things, and what can the children of lies tell vs but lies? Who is loiall and faithfull vnto him whome hee hareth, or whom commodity draweth awry? It is our Lord onely who giueth vs our ſight to ſee with, and teacheth vs which way we ſhould goe, and taketh away the ſtones leaſt wee ſtumble at them, and giueth vs counſell in all that wee haue to doe. Our Lord ſaith very well, that hee is the Lord who ſpeaketh iuſtice and righteouſneſſe: for there hath been no man ſaued vntill this day, whom he hath not counſelled, nor no man loſt whome hee hath not deceiued.

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:3666:84"/>hard in forgiuing his owne enemy; inſomuch that if he be iuſt in other mens iniuries, he is very vindicatiue of his owne. It is the property of a man, that if he haue much temporall goods at his commandement, he hath no vvill to ſpend them vvith any; ſo that if by the requeſt of friends, or importunitie of neighbours, he do part vvith any thing, he doth vveep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doth leaue it. It is the property of man, although not of a wiſe man, to deſire to be heard, although he cannot ſpeak, to be feared although he haue no authority, and wel beloued although he cannot loue, and be beleeued although he ſpeak not true, and he vvill bee ſerued although hee haue no need. What tongue can ſpeake it, and vvhat heart can ſuffer and endure to talke vvith a foole, to loue an vngratefull man, to aske and craue of a niggard, deale vvith a liar, and ſerue a proud man? Hee vvho forgetteth God, and dealeth vvith man, cumbereth himſelfe vvith all theſe inconueniences, and bindeth himſelfe vnto all theſe obligations, and the rather becauſe there is no man vvho truſteth long another man, but in the end is paied for it. To come then vnto our purpoſe, the good theefe was moſt happy in vvorſhipping Chriſt alone, and beleeuing in him onely: for reward vvhereof Chriſt ſaid vnto him alone and no other, This day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe. It is a great pitty to ſee how many Leuites and Prieſts, Lawyers and ancients, neighbours, and acquaintance of Chriſt vvere about the croſſe, looking how he ſuffered, &amp; vvatching how he died; vnto none of all vvhich he ſaid, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die me cum eris in Paradiſo,</hi> as he did vnto the good theefe; in ſo much that they heard the words, but vvanted the promiſe. Seeing our good Ieſus (ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>) vvas determined to giue the good theefe glory, vvhy did hee not giue it him, and hold his peace? And ſeeing hee did not ſend him vvord by a third perſon, vvhy did he not tell it him in ſecret, and in his eare? And ſeeing he vvould not tell him in ſecret, but pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, why did he not defer the reward? And yet if he would not defer the reward, vvhy did he not ſend him to heauen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but vvould take him to Paradiſe vvith himſelfe? All
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:3666:84"/>theſe are ſuch high myſteries and ſuch deepe ſecrets, that there is no wit able to vnderſtand them, nor tongue able to ſet them forth, nor hand able to write them, and therefore it is neceſſary for vs to craue for the grace of our Lord to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect vs in it, and the holy Ghoſt to lighten vs. When Chriſt ſaid vnto the theefe, This day thou ſhalt bee with mee in Paradiſe, it is as if hee had ſaid: O thou theefe my friend and fellow, ſeeing that I know with whome I ſpeake, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo reaſon, that thou doe know who ſpeaketh: and therefore I let thee vnderſtand, that I am the creator of heauen, I am the redeemer of the world, I am the Prophet which is deſired, I am the Meſsias promiſed, I am the giuer of the Goſpell, and I am alſo the Lord of Paradiſe. Let all men beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe with me, &amp; therefore I ſpeake it openly, that I bequeath my eternall Paradiſe vnto this theefe by this Will and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, becauſe that all ſuch which ſhall ſucceed me in my church, may know how well I recompence thoſe which ſerue me, and how well I deale with thoſe which follow mee. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelmus</hi> crieth out and ſaith, O glorious theefe, O happy theef, how fortunate and lucky waſt thou, ſeeing thou diddeſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that which did content our good Ieſus, nor ſaideſt nothing but that which well liked him! Thy feet with the which thou diddeſt follow him were happy, the eies with the which thou didſt ſuffer with him was happy, the tongue with the which thou diddeſt confeſſe him was happy, &amp; the heart with the which thou diddeſt beleeue in him was happy. S. <hi>Chriſoſt.</hi> noteth, That God did ſend <hi>Moiſes</hi> as an Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor to <hi>Pharaoh, Nathan</hi> the Prophet vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> the great Prophet <hi>Eſaias</hi> vnto <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> his holy Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> vnto King <hi>Ozias,</hi> the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> vnto <hi>Balthaſar,</hi> and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiricall Prophet <hi>Helias</hi> vnto king <hi>Achab.</hi> The ſonne of God ſent a greater imbaſie and greater Embaſſadours vnto the theefe, than God the father did vnto the Kings, ſeeing that vnto the theefe which was crucified on the croſſe with him, he ſent no other embaſſador than himſelfe, &amp; ſo by this
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:3666:85"/>meanes, the embaſie and the Embaſſador, were all one thing. Was it not think you the ſelfeſame thing, ſeeing that it was Chriſt which ſent the meſſage, &amp; the ſelfeſame Chriſt which carried it? <hi>Origen</hi> in an Homilie ſayth thus, The greateſt meſſage that euer came from heauen into the world was that of the incarnation, and the next vnto it was that which Chriſt did vnto the good theefe, inſomuch that by the comming of the ſonne of God the gate of glory was opened, and in the promiſe made vnto the good theefe the poſſeſsion of it was taken. The embaſie which <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> brought vs, was that the kingdome of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was at hand, but the good theef ſaith not that he is neer vnto heauen, but that he is within heauen, S. <hi>Iohns</hi> was a great embaſie, when he ſaid, Behold the lambe of God which taketh away the ſinnes of the world: but that of the theeues was better whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaid, Behold him here who hath already redeemed the world. The embaſie that <hi>Samuel</hi> brought vnto <hi>Dauid</hi> was good, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as of a ſhepheard he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed him king but the embaſie which Chriſt did vnto the good theef was farre better, becauſe that there paſſed almoſt fourty years betwixt the time that the kingdome was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> and the time that it was deliuered vnto him, but the theef had his kingdome promiſed him at two of the clock in the afternoone, and was giuen him preſently toward night. The reward for bringing thee news of ſuch a great em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſie as that of Chriſts was, that is, the promiſe of glory, he would let no man haue but he would win it himſelf; inſomuch he who promiſed glory &amp; gaue glory, was the glory it ſelf. O good Ieſus, redeemer of my ſoule, &amp; doſt thou well ſee that in promiſing glory &amp; Paradiſe that thou doeſt promiſe nothing but thy ſelf? what meaneth this O good Ieſus, what meaneth this? Doſt thou truſt malefactors, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thy ſelf vntorouers, offer thyſelf vnto ſinners, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit thy ſelf vnto theeues? If thou thinkeſt thy ſelfe ouercharged with this theefe, giue him the Prouince of Achaia, giue him part of Aſſyria, giue him the kingdome of Paleſtine, giue him the monarchy of Aſia: for in giuing him as thou doeſt giue him thy ſelfe, if thou were
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:3666:85"/>not God as thou art, it would ſeeme that thou ſhouldeſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice many. Is there any other Paradiſe but to enioy thee, is there any other glory than to ſee thy face, is there any greater contentment than to be in thy company, is there any goodneſſe but that which commeth from thy hands? This day thou ſhalt bee with me in Paradiſe, where thou ſhalt ſee me face to face, enioy my eſſence, dwell with my perſon, haue the fruition of my glory, thy death ſhall die, and thy life ſhall riſe againe.

This day thou ſhalt bee vvith mee in Paradiſe; vvhere there is no night which is darke, nor day which decreaſeth; no rough Winter, nor troubleſome Summer, no cold to freeze thee, no heat to diſtemper thee, no famine to weaken thee, no thirſt to make thee drie, no death to make thee afraid, nor life which ſhall haue any end. O my ſoule, O my heart, wilt thou not tell mee vvhat thou doeſt thinke vpon, or what thou doeſt contemplate on, ſeeing thou heareſt not this which is ſpoken: doeſt thou not marke vvho ſpeaketh it, nor vnto vvhom hee ſpeaketh it, nor doeſt thou regard vvhere it is ſpoken? Hee vvho ſpeaketh is the ſonne of God, hee vvith vvhom hee ſpeaketh is a theefe, that which he ſayth is that he promiſeth Paradiſe, the place vvhere hee ſpeaketh is the Mount of Caluary, the houre vvhen hee ſpeaketh is at the point of death, and thoſe before whome hee ſpeaketh is the vvhole Synagogue. Is it poſsible that an imbaſie accompanied vvith theſe many circumſtances, ſhould not bee new and heard?

Thou that ſitteſt ſporting thy ſelfe what doeſt thou aske of him who ſuffereth on the croſſe? Thou that art clothed and reclothed, what doeſt thou craue of him who is bowelled vpon the croſſe? Thou that art faire and fat, what doeſt thou aske of him who is on the croſſe, one member rent from one another? Thou that art at freedome and liberty, what doeſt thou aske of him who is nailed and faſtened vpon the croſſe?

Our Lord doth threaten the wicked whome hee meaneth to puniſh, with two grieuous ſcourges, that is, that hee will ſpeake in anger to feare them, and trouble their iudgement that they ſhall not bee able to gueſſe at any thing aright. If our Lord ſpeake vnto vs with anger, it may bee borne with, but if he trouble our iudgement, it is a thing much to be lamented: for in this wicked world, if he doe not lighten our ſteps to ſee where wee goe, wee ſhall fall downe vpon our face. <hi>Barnard</hi> crieth out and ſaith: What ſhall become of thee, O my ſoule, if he who ſhould lead me put mee out of the way, if hee who ſhould ſuccour me forſake mee, if hee who ſhould pardon me accuſe me, and he who ſhould quit mee condemne me, and he who ſhould giue mee ſight make mee blind? Saint <hi>Auguſtine De verbis Apostoli</hi> ſayth, When it is ſaid in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that God ſpeaketh vnto vs with anger, it is meant that he doth not ſpeake with mercy, and when it is ſaid that hee doth trouble vs with fury, it is to ſay that hee doth not lighten vs with his diuine grace, becauſe there cannot happen vnto vs greater hurt in this world, than for God to withdraw his hand from doing vs good. There is no anger in God, as there is in
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:3666:87"/>man, with the which hee doth trouble himſelfe, nor furie to moue him withall; and when wee ſay that he is angry, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he vſeth that puniſhment which in others is done with anger, and if we ſay that he is in fury, it is becauſe hee vſeth ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous puniſhment towards vs, or elſe becauſe hee doth not puniſh at all in this world: for wherin can our Lord ſhew grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter anger, than by not vſing his accuſtomed clemency? Our Lords wrath is appeaſed when hee puniſheth preſently after the offence committed, and he is very angry when hee defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the puniſhment vnto hell. S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſayth, That in the houſe of God, not to puniſh is to puniſh, to diſſemble is to bee angry with, not to ſpeake is to chide, to pardon is to threaten, to ſuffer is to let it putrifie, &amp; to defer is to reuenge the more. Is there, thinke you, any greater puniſhment, than not to bee puniſhed in this world? When doth our Lord ſpeake vnto vs with anger, but when wee fall from his grace into ſinne by our fault? God ſpake with anger vnto our firſt father, when hee ſaid vnto him thou ſhalt eat thy bread in the ſweat of thy face, as if hee would ſay, Becauſe thou haſt fallen from my grace, and eaten of the apple which I did forbid thee to eat of, for a perpetuall puniſhment, thou ſhalt eat and drinke alwaies with care in thy mind, ſweat on thy face, and trauaile of thy body, inſomuch that at the beſt morſell thou ſhalt giue ouer eating, and fall to ſighing. God ſpake alſo with anger vnto the murderer <hi>Cain,</hi> when hee ſaid vnto him, behold the bloud of thy brother <hi>Abel</hi> doth crie from the earth vnto mee: as if he would ſay Becauſe thou haſt flaine thy brother <hi>Abel</hi> through malice and enuy, I cannot but doe iuſtice vpon thee, becauſe his bloud crieth aloud for it of me; and thy puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſhall be, that thou ſhalt wander to and fro all the daies of thy life, and thy head ſhal neuer ceaſe ſhaking. God ſpake with anger vnto the great king <hi>Nabugodonoſer</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſaid, <hi>Eijciam te ab homini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> as if he would ſay, Becauſe thou haſt robbed my te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of their treaſures, and led away my people of the Iews captiue, thou ſhalt be throwne out fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the conuerſation of men, &amp; ſhalt liue with beaſts on the mountaines, thou ſhalt eat hay like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xen, and bee clothed like wild ſauages with haire, vntill thou
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:3666:88"/>doeſt acknowledge mee for to bee thy Lord, and thy ſelfe to bee a ſinner. God ſpake with anger vnto the great Prieſt <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi> when hee ſaid, <hi>Ego praecidam brachium tuum, &amp;c,</hi> as if hee would ſay, Becauſe thou diddeſt not puniſh thy children when they ſtole away the ſacrifices, and behaued themſelues diſhoneſtly vvith women in the Tabernacle, I will take thy Prieſthood from thee, I will kill thy ſteward, and will make that no old man come into thy houſe, in ſo much that thou ſhalt haue no children in thy ſtocke to inherite after thee, nor ancient men to counſell thee. To come then vnto our purpoſe, God vſed this kind of ſpeech vnto the Synagogue, but now ſpeaketh otherwiſe vnto the church, as is eaſily ſeene in the death of Chriſt, when hee ſaid vnto the theefe, <hi>Hodie mecum eris in Paradiſe.</hi> Wee doe not read that Chriſt did euer vſe this woord of anger ſo oft as hee hath done the woord of mercy, the which hee hath vſed often, as <hi>Per viſcera miſericor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diae dei nostra,</hi> ſaid holy <hi>Zachary</hi> in his ſong: as if he would ſay, The ſonne of God came downe from the higheſt of heauen into the earth, moued thereunto by the bowels of his mercy. The holy Prophet dooth in this open a high myſtery vnto vs, whereby hee giueth vs to vnderſtand, how entirely our Lord dooth loue vs, ſeeing that hee doth viſite vs vvith the bowels of his mercy. There bee many vvhich haue this word Mercy in their mouth, but not in their hands, and thoſe bee ſuch as are faire in ſpeech, but cruell in deedes, and ſuch vſe ſweet ſpeech to take men, and flattery to kill them. Others there bee which haue mercy in their handes, and nor in their tongues, the which are rough in words, but mild and gentle in deeds, and thoſe offer blowes but ſtrike not, they feare but kill not. Only our ſweet Ieſus hath mercy &amp; pity in his mouth, ſeeing hee dooth ſo much commend it vnto vs, and in his deedes ſeeing hee dooth vſe it ſo much, and alſo in his bowels becauſe hee dooth loue vs ſo much. S. <hi>Barnard</hi> ſayth vnto this purpoſe, Our Lord would not place mercy in the eies, leaſt they ſhould make him blind, hee would not place it in the eares, for feare they ſhould make him deaffe, hee would not
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:3666:88"/>place it in the handes, for feare it ſhould bee loſt, hee would not put it to keepe in the body for feare leaſt it ſhould grow old, neither yet in the tongue for feare hee ſhould be dumbe: But our good Ieſus put it to keepe in his heart to beſtow it vpon thoſe whom hee loueth, and keepeth it within his bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, becauſe that all that which is loued with the heart is kept within the heart. O good Ieſus, O the life of my ſoule, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee by the bowels of thy mercy, that thou wouldeſt take pity on my ſinfull ſoule, and ſeeing I haue no other Lord in my bowels but thy ſelfe, on whom wouldeſt thou bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beſtow the mercy which thou haſt within thine, than vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mee! Thou diddeſt ſpeake with the bowels of thy mercy, vnto the good theefe, when thou waſt not content onely to ſay: <hi>Amen,</hi> Truly I ſay, but thou diddeſt adde <hi>tibi</hi> to thee, letting vs vnderſtand, that thou diddeſt ſpeake vnto him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and promiſe Paradiſe vnto him alone and vnto no other. <hi>Vbertinus</hi> ſayth, That if when Chriſt ſaid <hi>Amen dico,</hi> hee had not added <hi>tibi,</hi> his mother who brought forth his humanity, and the other theefe which had loſt his liberty, might haue thought that hee had ſpoken vnto them, I ſay if hee had not turned himſelfe vnto the good theefe, and ſaid <hi>tibi.</hi> What meaneth this O good Ieſus, what meaneth this, doeſt thou ſpeake vnto the theefe, and forget thy mother? Doeſt thou not ſpeake vnto thy mother who bare thee nine months in her bowels, and doeſt thou ſpeake vnto the theefe who had knowne thee but three houres? Doeſt thou promiſe preſently Paradiſe vnto the theefe which ſpake but three words, and doeſt thou make no reckoning of thy mother, who bought thee with her teares? Doeſt thou beſtow thy preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous bloud, firſt vpon a theefe which knew not how to do any thing elſe but ſhed bloud by the high waies, before thou do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt beſtow it vpon thy mother? Would it not bee reaſon to pay thy mother now with the bloud that runneth from thy ſide, for the milke which thou diddeſt ſucke of her breaſt? What more heroicall and diuine exchange could there bee made in the world betwixt the ſonne and the mother, the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:3666:89"/>mother and the ſonne than bloud for milke, and milke for bloud? If thou doeſt looke O good Ieſus that ſhee ſhould ſpeake vnto thee as the theefe did, doeſt thou not ſee that for wearines ſhe cannot helpe thee, for griefe ſhe cannot looke vpon thee, for feare ſhee cannot comfort thee, and for being aſtonied ſhee cannot ſpeake vnto thee? I beſeech thee <hi>Per vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcera miſericordia,</hi> that thou wouldeſt ſay, <hi>Amen dico vobis,</hi> as thou doeſt ſay, <hi>Amen dico tibi:</hi> For by that means thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt comfort thy mother, ſatisfie the theefe, vanquiſhe Hell, helpe the world, and withall I ſhould haue hope to be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. If thou doeſt die for all and not for one, why doeſt thou not ſay, Verely I ſay vnto you, as thou doeſt ſay, Truly I ſay vnto thee? O ſweet Ieſus, and loue of my ſoule, ſeeing that vpon my knees, and my face bathed in teares, I ſay vnto thee, <hi>Tibi ſoli peccaui,</hi> I haue ſinned vnto thee alone, doe not I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue to heare from thy mouth theſe words, <hi>Amen dico tibi,</hi> Truly I ſay vnto thee? <hi>Anſelmus</hi> ſayth, That it was too time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to giue Paradiſe vnto his mother, and the other theefe had not deſerued it, and the great Centurion was not yet become a Chriſtian, and the Iewes were hardened in their hearts, and therefore it was not without cauſe that he ſaid vnto the theef, <hi>Amen dico tibi,</hi> and not <hi>Amen dico vobis.</hi> It was a great word which God ſpake vnto the firſt man, that is, <hi>dominamini piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibus maris, &amp; volatilibus cali:</hi> but that which hee ſpake vnto the good theefe was farre greater, becauſe it is far better to be companions vnto the Angels in heauen, than kings ouer beaſts vpon earth. It was a great word that God ſpake vnto <hi>Noe,</hi> that is, I found thee iuſt in my ſight: but this which hee ſpake vnto the theefe was far greater, becauſe it is better to be iuſt &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the reward of being iuſt, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be ſimply iuſt. That was a fauourable ſpeech which hee vſed vnto king <hi>Dauid,</hi> I haue found a man according vnto my heart: but this which he ſpake vnto the good theefe was farre more fauourable, becauſe that <hi>Dauid</hi> was but neere vnto his heart, but the theefe was in his heart. And it did appear eaſily, that <hi>Dauid</hi> was but neer Gods heart, ſeeing hee did ſinne afterward, and it doth well appeare
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:3666:89"/>that hee had the theefe within his heart, ſeeing hee ſuffered him to ſinne nor ſteale no more. That was a fauorable ſpeech which God vſed vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi> that is, <hi>Num celare potero qua geſturus ſum Abraham.</hi> But that which was vſed towards the theefe was more fauourable, becauſe the greateſt ſecret that God reuealed vnto <hi>Abraham</hi> was, that the ſon of God ſhould come into the world, but hee did not onely reueale, but alſo ſhew this vnto the good theef. Chriſt did truſt the good theef better tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he did truſt <hi>Abraham,</hi> becauſe he was the firſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner who ſaw the redemption of the world with his eies, &amp; he was hee vpon whome the bloud of Chriſt was firſt beſtowed. The precious bloud of the ſonne of God was then otherwiſe ſhed towards the theefe, who was vpon the croſſe, than to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his mother who was by the croſſe; becauſe it dropped downe vpon the garment of his ſorrowfull mother, but it went to the ſoule of the theefe to ſaue him, &amp; therevpon the holy theef went immediately to Paradiſe, but his ſorrowful mother ſtaied weeping on the Mount of Caluary. O holy bloud, O heauenly blame, why doeſt thou take ſuch pity on the theefe, &amp; doeſt deferre to giue thy mother the kingdome of heauen which thou doeſt giue preſently vnto the theefe? Doeſt thou defer it to her who brought forth Chriſt, &amp; take pity on him who bare him co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany on the croſſe, ſeeing thou doeſt augme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t tears in her, &amp; diminiſh offences in him? It was a word of great fauor which hee did vſe vnto <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> that <hi>Remiſsa ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi peccata multa,</hi> Many ſins are forgiuen thee: but yet that was greater which he did vſe to the good theefe, becauſe hee vſed greater liberty with him tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with hir: for if he loued her &amp; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned her, he loued the theef like a friend, pardoned him like a Chriſtian, &amp; rewarded him lika a iuſt man. <hi>Barnard</hi> ſaith vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this purpoſe, That it is a ſigne of great loue to pardon, but a greater ſign to giue &amp; pardon; becauſe that pardon is ſometime giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by force, but a gift neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth but of free wil. <hi>Orige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſayth, That Chriſt receiued in a new kind of martyrdome all the torments vvhich were giuen the theefe as a naughty man from the houre and moment that he defended Chriſt, and confeſſed with Chriſt: inſomuch that if he began to ſuffer like a theefe and a rouer, hee ended and died like a glorious martyr. This happy theefe was a very glorious mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, ſeeing he ſuffered neere Chriſt, and with Chriſt, &amp; where Chriſt ſuffered, and in the ſame manner that Chriſt ſuffered, and which is moſt of all, hee was the firſt martyr after Chriſts paſsion, and the firſt Saint which the ſonne of God did cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize after his death. S. <hi>Stouen</hi> was the firſt martyr after Chriſts aſcention, but from Chriſts death vntill he aſcended into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen there was no other Mattyr in the vvorld but the theefe, whoſe conuerſion Chriſt cauſed, whoſe teares hee accepted, whoſe martyrdome hee approued, whoſe paſsion hee canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and whoſe ſoule hee glorified. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> ſayth, O good Ieſus, O my ſoules delight, conſidering that thou doeſt ſaue him who accuſeth his owne faults, and him who excuſeth thy innocency, the maintainer of thy credit, the confeſſor of thy eſſence, the companion of thy perſon, wilt thou not ſaue alſo this ſinfull ſoule of mine? For ſo great a battaile as thou haſt won this day, for ſo great a victory as thou haſt obtained, and alſo for ſo much bloud as hath iſſued from thee, it is a ſmall prize to carry away with thee but one theef only, becauſe that by ſo much the greater the triumph is, by how many more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners the triumpher is followed with all. And if it will not pleaſe thee to take mee thither with thee, tarry thou here
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:3666:90"/>with me O good Ieſus, for I deſire no other glory of thee in this miſerable world, but that thou wouldeſt let mee haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies a good conſcience. <hi>Origen</hi> ſayth in an Homily, that it is much to be noted, and a thing to be wondered at, that Chriſt did not ſay vnto the theefe, <hi>Amen dico vobis,</hi> although there were many more there: but hee ſaid, <hi>Amen dico tibi,</hi> to let vs vnderſtand that by forgiuing him alone hee ſhewed his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and by not pardoning others hee ſhewed his great iuſtice. There were ſtore of ſinners about the croſſe as well as hee, which peraduenture would haue beene pardoned as well as he; but amongſt them all the theefe onely deſerued to heare his pardon: but by this hee maketh vs know, that there is no man which hath cauſe to diſpaire of pardon, ſeeing hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaue him; and yet that we preſume not too much of pardon, ſeeing he forgaue him alone. Let the concluſion of all this be, that wee remember before wee ſinne, that our Lord did not pardon the multitude that was there preſent; and after wee haue ſinned, let vs remember that hee pardoned the theefe which ſuffered with him: and in ſo doing we ſhall feare his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and remember his mercy: the which I humbly beſeech him that it would pleaſe him to vſe here with grace, &amp; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with glory, Amen, Amen.</p>

O fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and renowmed Iſrael, why doeſt thou not weepe for the loſſe of ſo many excellent men, which this day they haue ſlaine thee, and noble Princes which this day are periſhed within thee? How is it poſsible that the ſtrongeſt of Iſrael haue fallen downe ſo ignominiouſly, and the moſt famous of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:3666:91"/>Iuda haue ended their life by ſword? O how well king <hi>Saul</hi> &amp; <hi>Ionathas</hi> ſhould haue loued one the other when they were aliue, ſeeing that they left not the one the other in death, &amp; although the cruell ſword was able to take away their liues from them, yet certainly it was not able to take away their hearts from them with the which they loued one the other. What ſword durſt wound their hearts, or what launce durſt touch their fleſh, conſidering that <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Ionathas</hi> were in running more light than eagles, and in ſight more ſtrong than lions? <hi>Ionathas</hi> arrow was neuer ſhot but he hit, &amp; <hi>Sauls</hi> ſword drawn but he ſtroke. Weepe then O ye daughters of Iſrael, weep vpon the death of your king <hi>Saul,</hi> who clothed you in ſcarlet in your paſſeouer, and gaue you iewels of gold in your weddings. O ye mountains, O ye mountains of Gilboe, I curſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> henceforth &amp; anathematize you for euer, to the end that it neuer raign water vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you by day, nor any dew fal vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you by night, ſeeing that you conſented that the enemies of Iſrael ſhould there kill <hi>Saul,</hi> and ſlay my good friend <hi>Ionathas</hi> in the ſame place. O my faithfull and old friend <hi>Ionathas,</hi> why didſt thou goe to the battaile, not calling mee with thee, and why diddeſt thou die not taking mee with thee? My heart can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue no comfort, nor my eies ceaſe from weeping, when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how much I was bound vnto thee, and call to mind the great loue that paſſed betwixt vs, becauſe that the loue which paſſed betwixt thee and me, was of like quality, as the loue which a mother hath when ſhe hath but one child one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It is now to bee noted, that for this laſt word wee haue brought all this ſtory, whereby wee may well gather and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that the loue which a mother beareth vnto her onely ſonne, exceedeth all other humane loue. For if <hi>Dauid</hi> could haue found any greater loue, vnto a greater hee would haue compared his. King <hi>Dauid</hi> was a very holy man, and his ſonne <hi>Abſalon</hi> a very bold young youth, but in the end when newes came vnto him that <hi>Ioab</hi> had thruſt him through, and that he was hanged vpon an oake, the poore old man made ſuch piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:3666:92"/>complaint, and did ſhew ſuch griefe for it, that euery man did perceiue plainly, that he wiſhed himſelfe rather dead tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ſonne loſe his life. The which he openly ſaid when he cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aloud, My ſonne <hi>Abſalon,</hi> my ſonne <hi>Abſalon,</hi> where truly he would willingly haue gone to his graue if his ſonne might haue liued. God had no better experience to proue the loue which the Patriarch <hi>Abraham</hi> bare him, but to command him to kill his onely ſonne, which hee had in his houſe, and when the old man had lifted vp his ſword to ſlay the young youth, the Angell tooke him by the arme, and commanded him to be quiet: for now our Lord was ſatisfied, to ſee that he loued him better than his own ſon. When news was brought to holy <hi>Iob,</hi> how the wiſe men had robbed him of fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yoke of oxen, and that a flaſh of lightning from heauen had burnt him ſeuen thouſand ſheepe, and that the Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had taken from him three thouſand Camels, and had put to the ſword all the ſhepheards of his flocke, the good man was not grieued at all with it, nor vttered any ſorrowfull word forir. But when the fourth poſt came to bring him news, how they had ſlaine his ſixe ſonnes, and three daughters in his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſonnes houſe, the man of God could not diſſemble his great griefe, and did ſhew it more by deed than by word, by rending his garments in ſunder, and cutting his haire from his head, and wallowing oftentimes vpon the ground. Wee doe not read that the great Patriarch <hi>Iacob</hi> did weepe in all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regrinations, or complaine in all his tribulations, vntill hee heard that the wolues in the deſart had eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his welbeloued ſonne <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> the which euill news did ſtrike him ſo near the heart, that hee ſaid before his other children, that hee would die and goe into hell, becauſe hee might haue ſpace and time inough to bewaile his ſonne. <hi>Sunamites</hi> the Inne keeper of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria, and hoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:3666:92"/>her in, nor the Prophet comfort her. The great Prieſt <hi>Heli</hi> was ſo greeued vvhe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was told him that the Philiſtims had ouercome the Iewes, and taken the Arke and killed his two ſonnes <hi>Obni</hi> and <hi>Phinees,</hi> that he fell from his ſeat, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately yeelded vp the ghoſt. The wife of old <hi>Tobias,</hi> and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnto young <hi>Tobias,</hi> did weepe beyond all meaſure, and went almoſt beſide her ſelfe only at the long tarrying which her ſonne made in Rages a citie of the Medes, vvhether his father had ſent him, to take vp certaine money, and this her griefe was ſo exceſsiue that ſhe neuer ceaſſed to pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God for to keepe him, nor ſhe neuer left off weeping vntill ſhe ſaw him with her eies. I haue thought it expedient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe all theſe examples, the better to proue and extoll the loue which fathers and mothers beare vnto their children, and how it is not to bee compared with any other loue, and how bitterly the Parents weepe not onely for the death of their children, but alſo for their abſence. <hi>Horace</hi> ſaith, That to the loſſe of a child, and that of the onely child, there can bee no loſſe comparable vnto it, becauſe that cauſeth griefe at the heart, which is loued from the heart. <hi>Anſelmus</hi> ſayth to this purpoſe, that this fatherly loue is not found onely in men which are reaſonable: but alſo in brute beaſts, for we ſee the Henne fight with the Kite, the Storke with the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauke, the Mare with the Wolfe, the Lioneſſe with the Ounce, the Eliphant with the Rinoceront, the Gander with the dog, and the Pie with the Cuckow: the which fight is not only becauſe they be enemies, but becauſe they ſteale away their young ones. S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his Exameron ſaith, That the loue of the father is ſo great and ſo exceſsiue, that oftentimes we ſee brute beaſts follow men which haue taken away their yong ones, wherein they let vs vnderſtand that they had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be taken themſelues, than ſee their little ones taken cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues. If a br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:3666:93"/>thou haſt neuer been a father; nor what the loue of a ſonne is, becauſe that to haue a ſonne is the greateſt of all loues, &amp; to loſe him, the greateſt griefe of all griefes. To come at the laſt vnto our porpoſe, what woman did euer loue her ſonne, as the mother of God did loue hers? <hi>Ipſum ſolum tenet mater ſua, &amp; pater eius tenerè diligit eum,</hi> ſaid the Patriarke <hi>Iudas</hi> vnto the Patriarch <hi>Ioſeph</hi> his brother: as if hee would ſay, O moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed Prince <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> I and my brothers, and my brothers and I, doe humbly beſeech thee vpon our knees, and requeſt thee with many tears, that thou wouldeſt forgiue our yonger brother <hi>Beniamin,</hi> the taking away of the golden flask which was found in his bag, becauſe his dolefull mother hath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſon, and his old father loueth him with moſt tender loue. Theſe words may better be ſpoken of the virgin and of her ſonne, than of <hi>Beniamin,</hi> and his mother <hi>Rachel,</hi> who had more than one ſonne, although ſhee knew it not, ſeeing that <hi>Ioſeph Beniamins</hi> brother was aliue, &amp; the moſt richeſt &amp; mightieſt of all Egypt. The eternall father had no other ſonne but this alone, and the immaculate virgin had no other but Chriſt on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for the father neuer engendred other naturall ſon but this, and the mother neuer brought forth other ſonne but this. We may very well ſay of the father, that hee did loue his ſon ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, ſeeing hee gaue him all his nature, all his wiſedome, all his power, all his will, and alſo all his might and authority. What being had the father which the ſonne had not, what knew the father which the ſonne knew not, what could the father doe that the ſonne could not doe, what had the father that the ſonne alſo had not? What is it to ſay, that hee loued him tenderly, but that the father loued him with moſt entire loue, inſomuch that he denied him nothing which he had, nor hid nothing from him of that hee did know? Let vs leaue off the loue of the Father, and let vs ſpeake ſomewhat of the loue of the mother, who loued her precious ſonne with a tender heart, and wept for him with tender bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els. O moſt ſacred Virgine, how ſhouldeſt thou not loue thy bleſſed ſonne very tenderly, ſeeing that vvhen
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:3666:93"/>thou diddeſt bring him into the world, thou vvaſt young and tender? When the Virgine that bringeth foorth a child is tender, the child vvhich ſhee bringeth forth is tender; the time alſo young and tender, why ſhould not the loue with which ſhee loueth it bee alſo ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? If <hi>Iacob</hi> who had twelue children, loued one of them with tender and ſweet loue, is it to bee thought that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of God hauing but one onely ſonne, would not loue it with moſt tender and ſweet loue? and ſo much the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Iacobs</hi> loue was deuided into the loue of many ſonnes, but our bleſſed Ladies loue was wholly drawne to the loue of one only. S. <hi>Barnard</hi> vpon <hi>Miſsus eſt</hi> ſaith, That there is no loue vpon earth which may not bee waighed and meaſured, excepted only the loue which the ſonne of God bare vnto his mother, and the mother vnto her ſonne; the vvhich vvas ſuch, that all the Angels could not meaſure it, nor yet all the ſaints weigh it. <hi>Anſelmus</hi> ſaith, That thoſe which are fathers, and thoſe which are called mothers cannot loue their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as much as the Virgine did loue hers, nor yet they are not bound vnto ſo great loue; becauſe they are bound to loue their neighbours as themſelues, their brothers as themſelues, and their God more than themſelues. Loue which is deuided into ſo many parts, cannot poſsibly bee equall with that loue which the Virgine bare her ſonne. Loue that is pure and not fained, cannot bee ſpread abroad, but gathered in one, not in many but in one, not deuided but entire, not ſtroken but hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped vp, not for a time but for euer, not finding excuſes or faults but ſuffering, not ſuſpitious but confident and truſting. And he who obſerueth not theſe lawes, hath no cauſe to ſay that hee loueth. Theſe cauſes ought neither to want in him who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, nor in him which is beloued: for if they doe, wee ſhould not call them louers but acquaintance, for vnder the law of loue there is neither a defect admitted, nor a complaint ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. There is no defect admitted becauſe loue maketh all whole: there is no complaint ſuffered, becauſe loue maketh all gentle and mild: there is no iniury done becauſe loue
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:3666:94"/>diſſembleth all, there is no ſloth in loue, becauſe heis watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, he is not a niggard becauſe he can denie nothing. O glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Queene, O the light of my felicity, who did euer better keepe theſe high bonds of loue like vnto thee? The bleſſed mother of God, <hi>Tenerè diligebat filium ſuum.</hi> For being as he was fleſh of her fleſh, bones of her bones, bloud of her bloud, bowels of her bowels, how ſhould ſhe loue him, but like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her owne entrals? <hi>Tenerè diligebat filium ſuum,</hi> She loued her ſonne tenderly, ſeeing ſhe loued him as her ſonne, ſhe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him with the zeale due to a bride groome, ſerued him as her husband, vſed him as her brother, reuerenced him like a father, worſhipped him as a God. Shee loued him tenderly, ſeeing ſhe went to Bethelem, and with the teat in his mouth ſhe carried him into Egypt, and being a child of twelue years ſhe brought him into the Temple, and neuer forſooke him al the time that he went a preaching, and that which is moſt of all to be noted, ſhe wept for all his trauails and vexations, and with her fingers ends ſupplied all his neceſsities. And how did ſhee ſupply them but by watching in the night, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in the day? She loued him tenderly, ſeeing ſhee adored him in his preſence, ſhe contemplated on him in his abſence, ſhe ſuccoured him in his neceſsities, ſhee followed him in his iournies, and comforted him in his aduerſities. What would the child that the mother would not likewiſe, and what did the mother aske that the ſonne did not giue her? They liued in one houſe, they did eat at one table, and that which ſhee gained with her fingers was common betwixt them, and that which was giuen to him for preaching, they ſpent together. What ſhould I ſay more? they praied for all ſinnes together, and they wept for all ſinnes together.</p>

S. <hi>Barnard</hi> ſaith, O welbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued bride, why doeſt thou tel it abroad, that thy bridgroom carried thee to drinke into the wineſeller, &amp; taught thee how to bee farther in loue, ſeeing thou ſhouldeſt be angry to haue it ſpoken of, and to doe it thou ſhouldeſt be aſhamed? Other brides are wont to goe to the meddowes to gather flowers, to gardens to cut fruits, to ſhops to buy gownes, to the common places of recreation, to viſite their friends, and doeſt thou go to the wineſellers among the cups? Doeſt thou not know that the noble and fine dame is noted of Incontinency, if ſhe ſmell of nothing but of wine? So ſtrange a matter wine ought to be vnto thee O thou bride of the Lord, for to thinke of it would be imputed vnto thee for a curioſity, to aske for it an euill example, to ſmell of it a fault, to drinke it a ſcandall, and to bee dronke a ſacriledge. <hi>Plato</hi> ſayth, That in the glorious times and golden age of the world, kinſmen kiſſed their kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women for no other reaſon, but for to know whether they had drunk any wine for if they had they either were put to death for it, or baniſhed into ſome iſland. If <hi>Plutarch</hi> doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vs, it was an inuiolable law in Rome, that if any Matron
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:3666:95"/>of Rome had any neceſsity to drinke wine, either becauſe ſhee was weake, or becauſe ſhee was ſicke, the Senate onely ſhould giue licenſe vnto her, and ſhe notwithſtanding drinke it out of Rome. <hi>Macrobius</hi> ſaith. That two Senators chiding in Rome, the one told the other that his wife was an Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſe, &amp; the other replied and told him that his was a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard: and being debated in the Senate which of the two was moſt iniuried, it was agreed on by them al, that it was a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter infamy for a woman to be a drunkard than an adultereſſe. If this bee ſo, as true it is, why did this choſen dame &amp; dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty bride not onely drinke wine, but goe alſo to the ſeller for it? Why doth ſhe goe to fet it, &amp; if ſhe for it, why doth ſhe drink of it, &amp; if ſhe drink of it, yet why is ſhe drunke with it? What doe I ſay that ſhe is drunke with it, ſeeing ſhe doth inuite all men to drink of it? The ſpouſe which ſaith openly, <hi>Bibite amici &amp; inebriamini chariſſimi,</hi> what els doth ſhe ſay, but drinke my friends, &amp; you my deareſt of all be drunke?

Maruaile not my brother, maruell not to hear me ſay, that he brought mee into the wineſellers: for into the ſeller whither my deare bridegroome brought mee, there enter none but ſuch as are predeſtinated, and none but the choſen drinke of thoſe wines. <hi>Barnard</hi> ſaith, That the diuine ſeller whither this bridgroom brought his bride is the ſacred &amp; holy ſcripture, in which the veſſels are alſo the holy ſcriptures, &amp; the wine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thoſe veſſels was the ſon of God promiſed in the old law, &amp; that wine began to bee ſold, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good Ieſus began to preach. Why did the maiſter of the feaſt keep that wine to drink of in the end of the mariage, but only to let vs vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d that the cups &amp; myſteries of holy ſcripture were to bee opened in the end of the old law? Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt ſaid vnto his Apoſtles, Other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pains &amp; you are entred into their labors, in theſe
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:3666:95"/>words hee would ſay that the Fathers of the old Teſtament, haue planted &amp; pruned the vines, &amp; gathered the grapes, but yet the Apoſtles only drank of the wine, ſeeing they did reach vnto the ſecret myſteries of holy ſcripture. Our Lord did put all the twelue Princes of the church in this ſeller, when in the parler he made them drunk with the grace of the holy ghoſt, by reaſon of which drunkenneſſe there was no ſecret which they did not reach vnto, nor myſtery which they did not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. O precious wine, O happy drunkennes! conſidering that at that very hour, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Princes of the church entred into that ſeller, of fearful me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they became ſtout, of ſimple men learned, of dul men very wiſe, &amp; being without deuotion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came very ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; of dumbe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> very eloquent, &amp; of fiſhers preachers.

Who would not drink of ſuch wine as this is, &amp; who would not enter into ſo bleſſed a buttery? <hi>Origen</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Canticles ſaith, That the ſeller of wine vnto the which the bridegroom brought his bride, is no other thing tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this holy catholick church, where the cups are the ſacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, &amp; the wine which is kept in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are the ſeuen gifts of the holy ghoſt, by whoſe means the church can neuer erre, &amp; without the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can euer be ſaued. What ſhold become of the child new born, who hath neither faith nor hope, if he were not put preſently into that glorious ſhop?

Behold then how this wine is kept, &amp; how the laſt
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:3666:96"/>cup endeth with our life, and our life with the laſt cup. This grape out of the which this precious wine came out of, was firſt formed in Nazareth, borne in Bethelem, brought vp in Paleſtine, the vintage made on the Mount of Caluary, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vpon the croſſe, where all the bloud which ran from the ſonne of God, was turned into wine for to drinke of in his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke church. It is a common Prouerbe vſed by one friend vnto another, that he will giue him all that he asketh, yea al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo his bloud; which offer wee ſee made, but fulfilled of none. Why doeſt thou offer thy friend that thou wilt ſhed thy bloud for him, if hee require it at thy hands, and afterwards if he aske thee any thing, thou turneſt thy face from him? The ſonne of God is none of theſe certainly, who ſaying and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gaue vs his body to eat, and his bloud to drinke, with the which we were redeemed, and by the which all the elect are ſaued. O good Ieſus, with what wine doeſt thou make the ſoule of thy beſt beloued drunke, but with the wine of thy precious bloud? <hi>Vidi mulierem ebriam, &amp;c,</hi> I ſaw a woman drunke with the bloud of the ſaints, ſayth S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calips chap. 17, as if he would ſay, Being in baniſhment in the Iſle of Pathmos, among other viſions which I ſaw there, I ſaw a woman which was drunk, but not with the wine, which was made of grapes, but with bloud which iſſued out of vains. We ſee men drunke with wine euery day: for with this kind of drunkenneſſe the good Patriarch <hi>Noe</hi> was drunke, &amp; the couetous <hi>Nabal, Cornelius,</hi> and the prowd captain <hi>Holofernes.</hi> We ſee men drunke with anger alſo euery day, and with this kind of drunkenneſſe king <hi>Iehu</hi> was drunke when hee ſlew in one day ſeuenty of king <hi>Achabs</hi> children, and when the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine <hi>Ioab</hi> ſlew the captaine <hi>Abner.</hi> Wee ſee many drunke with enuy euery day, as <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethren when they ſold him for enuy, &amp; the wicked Pharaſies which put Chriſt to death for enuy.

Wee haue read of no drunkards, we haue ſeene no drunkards, nor yet heard of any drunkards, which haue made themſelues ſuch onely vvith pure bloud: for although barbarous men loue to ſhed bloud, yet they loue not to drinke it. The catholicke church hath no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The Apoſtles vvere drunke vvith this kind of drunkenneſſe, when they ſaid, Wee muſt rather obey God than man, and S. <hi>Peter</hi> was drunke in this ſort, when hee ſaid, Let vs make three Tabernacles in this place, and S. <hi>Paul</hi> when hee ſaid, I am not ready onely to be bound, but alſo to die, and S. <hi>Laurence</hi> when he ſaid, it is broi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led inough, turne it now and eat of it. The more pure wine S. <hi>Steuen</hi> had drunke of, the more impatiently hee would haue felt the ſtones vvhich hee vvas ſtoned vvith, and S. <hi>Laurence</hi> the coales, and S. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> his ſword: but after they had entred into this holy ſeller, and drunke of this holy bloud, he ſuffered the ſtones as if they had been roſes, and the coals as if they had been lillies. And therefore the bride had great reaſon to commend, and not to bee angry with her loue, for bringing her into this diuine ſeller, where ſhee ſlept without being awaked, and vvatched and yet ſate not vp all night, and entred into it without infamy, and liued with change, and did eat without paying for the ſhot. O good Ieſus, O the glory of my ſoule, wilt thou not let me goe into this holy tauerne, to drinke there if I luſt one drop? Giue me leaue O good Ieſus, giue me leaue, becauſe I may know thy grace, and taſt of thy precious bloud: for of all other drinkes in the world, the more I drinke of them, the greater thirſt I feele of all the drops
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:3666:97"/>of bloud which thou haſt ſhed moſt freely, wilt thou not giue mee one to aſſuage the thirſt of this ſinfull ſoule? It is alſo to bee noted, that the bride doth not only boaſt that her bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome did bring her to the tauerne to drinke, but did alſo teach her there the order which ſhe ſhold keep in louing, in ſo much that of a plain maid, he taught her to be a curious louer. This that the bride ſaid, <hi>Ordinauit in me charitatem,</hi> is worthy of great heed, ſeeing that by that the Scripture will let vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that there is no loue firme and ſtable, if there be not an order in the maner of louing. If there be (ſaith <hi>Ouid</hi>) an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in fiſhing, in fouling, fighting, ſhall there not be alſo in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing? And he ſaith further that all which fiſh loue not, nor all which hunt loue not, nor al which fight loue not: but al which loue, fiſh, hunt, and fight, becauſe he fiſheth well who fiſheth for others good wil, &amp; he hunteth well who hunteth after o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bowels, &amp; fighteth wel who fighteth for anothers hart. S. <hi>Barnard</hi> ſaith, Take heed O my ſoule, take heed, that that do not happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto thee, that happeneth in vain worldly loue, where often thoſe which loue chide, &amp; thoſe diſagree which loue wel, not ſo much for any treaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which the one hath done to the other, as for want of order in louing. He who is not wiſe in his loue, is not my friend but my enemy, hee doth not loue me but diffame me. <hi>Origen</hi> vpon theſe words ſaith, That whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is no order in loue, al endeth in diſorder: for loue endeth in hatred, well-willing in deteſting, ſeruing in offending, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing into diffaming, ſpeaking into not hearing, care into forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes, dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce into ſlouth, ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> viſiting into long abſence, and ſighing into co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaining. S. <hi>Auguſt</hi> ſaith, O how well the bride ſaith, he hath ſet charity in me in good order, becauſe that by how much the more ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the zeale is, &amp; the ſpirit veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and the loue ſodain, by ſo much the more it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient, that he who loueth be wiſe, becauſe that the zeale may be printed in him, &amp; the ſpirit moderated in him, &amp; charity ſet in order. <hi>Anſelmus</hi> ſaith alſo. O how well my good Ieſus hath ſet cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in good order in me, when he giueth me his holy grace to loue our Lord only for himſelf, &amp; in himſelf, &amp; by himſelf, &amp;
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:3666:97"/>giueth me alſo grace to loue my neighbor only for God, and in God, and becauſe he is the houſe of God. <hi>Cyprian</hi> vpon the Creed ſayth, He cannot bee ſaid with truth, that <hi>Ordinauit in me charitatem,</hi> vvho loueth God not becauſe hee is good, but becauſe he ſhould giue him Paradiſe, and hee who forſaketh ſinne not becauſe it is naught, but for feare of hell, and if he loue his neighbour it is not becauſe hee is a Chriſtian, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee is his friend, in ſo much that ſuch a one would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loue God, nor his neighbor, but in hope to get ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite by it. This kind of loue the Deuill had in the beginning, vvho when he ſhould haue loued God in God, and for God, loued himſelfe in himſelfe, and for himſelfe; inſomuch that when he went about to climbe aboue himſelfe, he fell lower than himſelfe. Then God doth ordaine all things in charitie (ſayth <hi>Remigius</hi>) when he ſetteth mee in the right way, and doth lighten me, and when my loue beginneth in him, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth in him, and endeth in him: becauſe that cannot be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led true loue, which is not grounded in God for God and by God. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in an Homily ſaith, I will ſay the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the bride that he hath ordained charity in me, when hee hath ſet ſuch order to my eies, that they ſee no vaine thing, and when hee ſtoppeth my ears that they heare no prophane things, &amp; bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle my tongue that he ſpeak no ſuperfluous things, &amp; ſhut vp my heart that hee deſire no forbidden thing. S. <hi>Gregory</hi> vpon <hi>Iob</hi> ſayth, That ſeeing there is nothing bad but that which our Lord hath forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, we dare ſay boldly, that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to deſire that which is not lawfull for him to get.

The Angels in heauen, neither yet the holy men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted did not reach vnto ſo many ſecrets of God, as the mother of God did: becauſe it is to bee beleeued, that hee who did truſt and credite her, would hide nothing from her. O mother of my redeemer, tell mee what couldeſt thou not doe, what hadſt thou not, or what didſt thou not know when thou haddeſt my God in thy wombe? O Virgin bleſſed and beloued of the Lord, thou maiſt well ſay, <hi>Dilectus meus mihi, &amp; ego illi,</hi> ſeeing that if he hath placed thee in his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſtorehouſe, thou diddeſt put him in thy virgins wombe, where thou diddeſt teach him to know what it was to bee a man, and hee taught thee what it was to bee the mother of God. As <hi>Iobs</hi> ſonnes went ſporting themſelues from houſe to houſe, ſo the mother of God and the ſonne of God went from ſeller to ſeller recreating themſelues, and the mother told the ſonne what hee ſhould haue in this world, and the ſon told the mother how they ſhold reſt in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the which ſpeeches the holy Orders of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were not worthy to hear.

The great Chronicler S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, That the firſt time that the mother of our Lord went abroad, the mother and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> her and were in a maze, and wondered at that that <hi>Simeon</hi> ſaid of the child, and of that which the holy woman <hi>Anna Phanuel</hi> prophecied of him before them all. S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> vpon this place ſaith. If the great wonders which <hi>Simeon</hi> ſpake of Ieſus the child, did make the mother ioifull, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they put the Angels in a wonder and maruell, becauſe they ſaid of him, that he ſhould be the light of the Gentiles, the glory of the Iewes, and the redeemer of all Nations. And <hi>Simeon</hi> not contented with that which he had ſaid, although he were very ioifull of that which he had ſeene, ſaid further that hee deſired not to liue any longer in this world but die preſently, ſeeing that he had already ſeene with his eies that which his hart had ſo long time wiſhed for. It is a natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the hart which hath long wiſhed for any thing, if at any time he hath that before his eies which he bought with many ſighes rather to deſire to die, than to be ſeperated from the ſame. <hi>Origen</hi> vpon <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, That all the praiſes which <hi>Simeon</hi> ſpake of the ſonne of God, moued the mother to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther loue: for if he ſaid that her ſonne was the light, ſhe knew that ſhee firſt of all receiued light; if hee ſaid that her ſonne was honour, ſhe knew that hee had firſt of all honoured her; inſomuch that the Virgin did already poſſeſſe all that which

It is here to bee noted, that <hi>Simeon</hi> did not ſay ſimply, Thou ſhalt be the glory of the people of Iſrael, but he added more and ſaid, thou ſhalt bee the glory of thy people of Iſrael: the which he ſaid for the wicked and peruerſe of the Synagogue who although they were in the people of the Iewes, yet they were not of the people of Iſrael. <hi>Abel, Seth, Noe, Sem, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iacob, Ioſeph,</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> and all the Prophets were of the people of God, of all whome the ſonne of God was the honour and glory, ſeeing they beleeued in him, before that he came into the world, and were ſaued in the faith in which they liued. <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Cham, Iſmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau, Roboam</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalia, Ieſabel, Annas &amp; Cayphas</hi> did all dwel among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, but they were not of the elect number of the people of God, becauſe that no man can bee called a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of the children of God, but hee who beleeueth ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly in God. Let me (ſaith <hi>Chryſostome</hi>) be of the number of the people of God, becauſe I may bee lightened with thy light, and glorified with thy glory, ſeeing that no man can be lightened but whome thou doeſt lighten, nor glorified, but whom thou doeſt glorifie. O how many there bee at this day in the church that be not of the church, and how many in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which bee not of the religion! Becauſe that our perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and ſaluation doth not conſiſt in the names wee beare, nor in the places we haue, but in the good or euil liues which we lead. What doth it auaile me to bee called a Chriſtian, if I lead the life of a Pagan, or what doth it helpe me to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a religious man if I liue like a worldling? As the ſonne of God came into the world not to the honour of thoſe which
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:3666:99"/>were in the people, but of thoſe which were of the people, ſo thou my brother ſhouldeſt bee of the number of the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and not in the number: for otherwiſe thou ſhalt be as <hi>Saul</hi> was among the Prophets, and as Sathan vvas amongſt the children of God. <hi>Origen</hi> ſayth, That when <hi>Simeon</hi> did deuide Chriſts gifts, he gaue light vnto the church: ſaying, <hi>Lumen ad reuelationem gentium,</hi> A light to the reuelation of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles: and he gaue the Iewes honour and glory, ſaying, <hi>Ad glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam plebis tuae Iſrael,</hi> which honour and glory they deſerued to loſe when they went about by all the means they could to diſhonour the ſonne of God vpon the croſſe. The ſon of God gaue great honour and glory vnto the Synagogue, if the Iews could haue known it; and that is, in that he vouchſafed to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend of them, and bee borne amongſt them, and in that hee would conuerſe among them, &amp; preach among them, and do ſo many miracles to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but becauſe they knew him not, nor were not gratefull vnto him for it, all that glory and fame is turned into their diſhonor and infamy. The light which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened vnto the Gentiles, of which our holy mother the church is diſcended, was neuer taken from them, as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was taken from the ſorrowfull Iewes: for ſince that the holy Ghoſt was ſent vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the holy Apoſtles, we neuer ſaw the church of God erre nor go aſtray. O what inſpeakable ioy the mother of God receaued at that time, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe ſaw her preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſon preſented vnto the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, offered to holy <hi>Simeon,</hi> praiſed of <hi>Anna</hi> the Propheteſſe, &amp; the vſuall offering offered vp for him! His mother reioiced much to haue him in her armes, to looke on him with her eies, to giue him ſuck with her breaſts, to offer ſacrifices for him, and to hear thoſe maruellous things which the old men ſpake of him. The Virgin then being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ioifull to heare <hi>Simeon,</hi> and much more of that which ſhee ſaw in her ſon, the good old <hi>Simeon</hi> turned himſelfe vnto our Lady, and did behold her ſaying, <hi>Ecce hic poſitus eſt in ruinam,</hi> as if hee would ſay, I haue often told thee, my daughter, that this my Lord and thy ſonne ſhould be the light of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and the glory of the Iewes: but now I tell thee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that he ſhall be a ſtumbling blocke for many to fall by,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:3666:100"/>and a helpe for many to riſe by againe, and hee ſhall bee as it were the white in a butt, which very many ſhall ſhoot at, but few at all hit. <hi>Dauid</hi> in his Pſalme ſpake of Chriſt, that which vvas not vnlike vnto that that <hi>Simeon</hi> ſpake of Chriſt; that is, <hi>Cadent in retitulo eius omnes peceatores,</hi> as if hee would ſay, All the ſinners of the vvorld ſhal fall into his nets, my ſelfe excepted who am ſaued by ſpecial priuiledge. And it is much to bee noted, that the Prophet doth not ſay, that there is not any one conſtrained to fall into the net, but they will fall into it of their owne voluntary vvill, and entangle themſelues; and ſo vve may ſay that there is no fault of the maiſters net, if he making and arming his net to take fiſh, yet men will fall, into it. Neither did <hi>Simeon</hi> ſay, when he ſpake of Chriſt, that hee ſhould be the fall of many; but hee ſaid, <hi>Poſitus eſt in ruinam,</hi> Becauſe there is very great difference if I make you fall, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you vvould not fall, or to fall or ſtumble on me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my making you fall. <hi>Remigius</hi> vpon S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, That notwithſtanding that <hi>Dauid</hi> doth ſay that all ſinners ſhal fall into his net, and that <hi>Simeon</hi> doth ſay that hee is put a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocke, I ſay that notwithſtanding all this, wee ſhould beare falſe witneſſe againſt the ſonne of God, if wee ſhould ſay that hee hath beene the cauſe that any man hath fallen from the faith: for it cannot be ſpoken of the ſelfe ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that he is come to redeeme vs, and that hee is the cauſe of our damnation. If I make a bridge ouer the which all men may goe ouer a ſtrong and a dangerous riuer, what fault am I in, if you caſt your ſelfe downe from it into the riuer, ſeeing that I made it to the end that you might goe ouer ſafely, and you would needes throw your ſelues headlong into the vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? When the ſunne doth caſt his morning beames ouer all the world, what fault is he in, if through his heat and bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe the durt be hardened, and waxe made ſoft? If there be a ſtone put to paſſe ouer a quagmire or durtie place, and you fall and beray your ſelfe, what fault is the ſtone in, ſeeing that you could not ſtand vpon it? The ſonne of God was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in this world, but a bridge for vs to paſſe ouer, and a
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:3666:100"/>ſunne with the which wee ſhould haue lightened our ſelues, and a ſtone vpon which we ſhould tread on, and a ſword vvith the which we ſhould haue defended our ſelues: and ſhall hee then be in any fault, if wee turne that into poyſon, which hee gaue vs for triacle? <hi>Caſsiodorus</hi> vpon the Pſalme ſaith, That all the ſinners of the earth ſhall fall into his net without any fault at al in the ſon of God: for ſeeing he came into the world, preached vnto the world, amended the world, taught the world, and redeemed the world, what fault is there in him, if a man damne himſelfe, conſidering that hee will not keepe the law which is giuen him by God? Chriſts holy law is not an occaſion for vs to fall, nor ſuſpicious to be beleeued in, nor obſcure to bee vnderſtood, nor hard to bee kept, in ſo much that the danger is not in that which he commandeth vs, but in that that we doe diſobey his commandement. Then when old <hi>Simeon</hi> doth ſay of Ieſus the child, that hee is put for a ſtumbling blocke vnto many, he wil not ſay that the ſonne of God ſhould be a cauſe that many ſhould be caſt away in his church, but that many would fal from his holy law, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially more perfideous Iewes than of others, who when they ſhould haue been blowers abroad of his holy doctrine, were hangmen of his holy life. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth, That all Gentiles haue fallen into his net vvhich know him not, all Iewes by not receauing him, all Tyrants by perſecuting his Martyrs, all Heretikes by falſifieng ſcriptures, and all naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men fall daily by blaſpheming his name. Of the ſame flowr that the Bee gathereth honny, the ſpider maketh poyſon: rattes bane to poyſon vvith, and triacle to help men vvith, is made of the ſame thing: the roſe which ſmelleth ſweet, &amp; the adder which biteth deadly, is often bred in the ſame buſh, &amp; of the ſame wood men do oft cut timber to couer a church, &amp; to make a gibbet. Good iudgements by theſe examples may eaſily perceiue that which I haue ſaid to bee true vvithout further triall. What fault may bee imputed vnto the ſonne of God if of the ſame holy law the Iew gather poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the Chriſtian honny; the infidell gathereth
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:3666:101"/>gall, and the faithfull man honny, the naughty man adders, the good man roſes, the iuſt man findeth a church to ſaue him in, and the tyrant maketh a gallowes to damne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe on. It is alſo to bee noted, that ſinners will fall not into a net, but they will fall into <hi>reticulo</hi> a ſmall net: for if we wil wel looke vnto it, Chriſt hath put before vs more reaſons to ſaue our ſelues, than the Deuill hath ſet occaſions before vs to damne vs. They are but ſmall nets which the deuill doth ſet before vs to fall into, but they are very great and large nets, which God putteth to catch vs; but yet alas if there fall tenne into Chriſts net, there fall tenne thouſand into the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils ſmall net. <hi>Cyrillus</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayth, That according vnto the prophecy of <hi>Simeon</hi> and of <hi>Daniell,</hi> the ſonne of God came for the fall of the Babilonians, Egyptians, Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans, Perſians and Medes, Greekes and thoſe of Paleſtine, becauſe the law of the Goſpell hath been preached and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in thoſe places. <hi>Chryſostom</hi> ſaith, That the ſon of God came to take fleſh for the fall of the Temple of <hi>Salomon,</hi> the city of Ieruſalem, the ſacrifices of Iuda, the ceremonies of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell, and of the old Moſaicall law, and of the pride of all the Synagogue, which was all ended and gaue vp the ghoſt with this word, <hi>Conſummatum eſt.</hi> The ſonne of God came into the world for the ouerthrow of all ſinnes: for if hee was, as hee vvas, the truth it ſelfe, hee was a great enemy of lies, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he highly loued charitie he hated cruelty, and becauſe hee highly commended humilitie, hee perſecuted enuy, vvhich vvas the cauſe that no man did euer reprehend vice more ſharplier than hee, nor no man did euer extoll vertue like vnto him. The ſonne of God came into the vvorld, to the vtter ruine of the famous city of Hieruſalem, ſeeing there vvas not one tower in the citie vvhich vvas not throwne downe, no vvall which was not broken, no houſe vvhich vvas not barnt, no Temple vvhich vvas not bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the ground, no treaſurie vvhich vvas not robbed, nor orchard vvhich vvas not ſpoiled, no Virgine vvhich was not violated, no woman which was not forced, no man
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:3666:101"/>which was not either ſlaine or taken captiue. The ſonne of God came into the world for the ouerthrow of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, ſeeing he left them no kingdome whither to goe vnto, no citie where to dwel, no king to rule them, no Patriarke to honour, no Prophet to giue them counſell, no army to defend them, no captain to fight for them. The ſoune of God came into the world <hi>in ruinam</hi> the ouerthrow of the Phariſies and Sadduces, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering that he took away their hypocriſie from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by which they preuailed, their authority by which they commanded, their doctrine with which they deceaued, their couetouſneſſe with the which they robbed, and their Symo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with the which they made themſelues rich.</p>

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:3666:102"/>and good men ſhould bee raiſed vp by him, becauſe it is the dutie of a good Phiſitian not only to purge the humor which offendeth, but alſo to ſtrengthen it. What fruit ſhould we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by his comming into the world, if he ſhould only throw downe the wicked, and not raiſe vp the good? Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our Lord ſaith by <hi>Ieremy, Conſolabor me de inimicis meis,</hi> he would vvith a farre better will forgiue vs, rather tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> puniſh vs: but becauſe all that is in God, is God himſelfe, hee cannot doe leſſe than vſe his iuſtice, giuing notwithſtanding alwaies place vnto his mercy. When he ſayth, Woe bee vnto mee, vvoe be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, I muſt reuenge mee of my enemies, what can bee ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with a more tender heart, or vvhat iuſtice can bee done vvith greater mercy, ſeeing that hee firſt weepeth for the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner before he puniſh the ſinne, and firſt ſhed many tears, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſhew diſcipline vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the malefactors?

This ſpeech of the Prophet is vvorthy to bee noted and alſo vvept, and to bee bewailed vvith many teares, ſeeing that hee telleth vs and admoniſheth vs by it, how little vvee are able to doe of our ſelues, how little wee are worth, how little wee poſſeſſe, how little vvee know, ſeeing that it is in our owne power to fall, but vvee are not able to riſe vvithout the helpe of God.

S. <hi>Barnard</hi> to this purpoſe ſaith, It may be ſaid better of me than of any, O my good Ieſus, That thy perdition is of thy ſelfe Iſrael, and thy ſaluation of mee.

Heale me Lord, and I ſhall be healed, of my vnruly deſires, of the wantonneſſe of my eies, of my ouermuch ſpeaking, of the coldnes of my workes, of the ſtealth of my hands, of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of my thoughts, and of the worme of my couetouſnes. O good Ieſus, my only truſt, heale my ſoule, becauſe I haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended thee in thought, I haue offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded thee in delight, I haue offended thee in omiſsion. I haue offended thee in conſent, &amp; I haue offended thee in deed, &amp; therefore vnto thee my fault I confeſſe, and therfore good Ieſus take pity vpon me.

Who is he (ſaith <hi>Aymon</hi>) who co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth vs to waſh our ſelues, but only the eternal father, &amp; who is he who waſheth vs, but only his precious ſon, &amp; with what doth he waſh vs, but with his holy bloud, and who bee thoſe which he doth waſh, but ſuch as are of his holy church? O glorious Iſope, and happy waſhing place, in the which the Angels if they had licenſe to come down, and the heauenly powers if they durſt, would waſh themſelues in? There were many riuers in Samaria, but <hi>Naaman</hi> was healed in none but in the riuer of Iordan: there were many ceſterns &amp; pooles in Ieruſalem, but the diſeaſed were helped only in the Probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca. There were many fountaines in Paleſtine, but <hi>Dauid</hi> could neuer ſlacke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his thirſt, but in the fountain of Bethelem.
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:3666:104"/>Wee will inferre of all this, that there hath been very much bloud ſhed in the world, but none could euer make vs cleane, but only the bloud of Chriſt. All water waſheth not, euery fiſh poole maketh not cleane, euery fountaine filleth not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth all bloud make whole: a beaſts bloud hurteth, mans bloud defileth, but the bloud of Chriſt doth make whole, doth waſh, doth fill, and content. If wee looke curiouſly into the Scripture, and eſpecially into the Apocalips, thou ſhalt find it to bee true, that S. <hi>Iohn</hi> did not ſee any Saint of heauen waſh himſelfe in the water which did run in the riuer, but onely in the bloud which did run from the lambe. O of what great vertue this holy bloud is of, ſeeing that for to waſh vs and bath vs in it we need no great quantity, but a very ſmal deale! which is eaſily ſeene in that the Prophet doth not ask, that he would make him a pole of bloud to waſh him in, but that it would pleaſe him to ſprinckle him with a little Iſope dipped in it. A very little is ſufficient, O my good Ieſus, and it ſufficeth to be ſprinckled with it, and not waſhed, ſeeing that one drop of thy precious bloud, ſufficeth to fil thy glory with many, and to people thy church with many good men. It is much to be noted, that he vſeth this word Sprinckle me with Iſope, and I ſhall be made cleane: for by caſting water with I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſope, one drop falleth here, and another there, this man is wet with it, and that man is drie: euen ſo it falleth out in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing of Chriſts holy bloud: for although it were ſhed for all the world, yet notwithſtanding it was not emploied vpon all men. The bloud of the ſonne of God is ſprinkled with I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſope, ſeeing that the Chriſtian is ſaued with it, and the Pagan condemned, the inſt is made cleane, &amp; the naughty man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth vncleane, the vertuous man is bedewed with it, and the vicious man remaineth dry, and that which is more to be lamented, ſome doe there waſh away their offences, &amp; ſome haue not one drop of it. The Prieſt in the Leuiticall law did clenſe ſuch as were infected with a leproſie if they came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and if they brought thoſe things which the law pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and if they were ſprinckled ſeuen times with the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:3666:104"/>bloud of the bird: but if they refuſed to doe any of theſe things, the Prieſt was in no fault, and their vncleanneſſe vvas imputed vnto themſelues. The High prieſt the ſonne of God, did die for all men, and ſhed his bloud for all men: but if thou Infidell or Heretike, wilt not enter into the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke church, if thou ſinner or naughty man wilt at the time, when it is deſtributed turne thy face from it, what fault is in Chriſt if his precious bloud worke no vertue in thee? O how happy that ſoule is, vpon whom there falleth one drop not of the bloud which the prieſt ſprinckled, but this precious bloud which the ſon of God ſheddeth! for being waſhed in ſo deep a poolſhe wil go beyond the ſnow in whitenes, &amp; exceed the ſon in clearnes. It is time now for vs to come vnto our firſt purpoſe, &amp; apply all this vnto that which holy <hi>Simeon</hi> ſpake of Chriſt. When <hi>Simeon</hi> ſayth of Chriſt, that he is put to helpe vp ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and when the Prophet ſaith O Iſraell thy perdition com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of thy ſelfe, and thy ſaluation of mee, and when <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, Heale me Lord and I ſhal be made whole, and on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide Sprinckle me Lord with Iſope, and I ſhal bee made cleane, hee letteth vs vnderſtand plainly, that if wee bee not made cleane by the mighty hand of the ſon of God, no man elſe hath the power to doe it. Wherefore ſayth <hi>Irenaeus</hi> did the redeemer of the world come into the world, but becauſe wickedneſſe and wicked men ſhould fall downe, and becauſe vertue and vertuous men ſhould riſe? By his comming into the world, idolatry fell downe, and the true faith was ſet vp; Hypocriſie was beaten downe, and truth lifted vp; tyranny fel downe, and iuſtice lifted vp; malice fell downe, and innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy lifted vp; reuengement fell downe, and mercy lifted vp. If thou doſt come into the world (ſaith <hi>Vbertinus</hi>) becauſe that all naughtineſſe and naughty men ſhould fall, who in all the world is ſo wicked as my ſelfe, or who fallen ſo low? What greater fal than to be fallen from thy grace? Come the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſweet Ieſus, come to the lifting vp of my vertues, and come to the fall of my vices: for if thou doe not make my vices firſt to fal, my vertues can neuer riſe. Note (ſaith <hi>Remigius</hi>) that <hi>Simeon</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:3666:105"/>firſt ſaid of Chriſt, that hee was come <hi>in ruinam,</hi> before hee ſaid that he was <hi>in reſurrectionem,</hi> becauſe it is impoſsible that humility ſhould riſe in mee before that my pride bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne, neither can patience riſe in me, if my anger firſt fall not, neither my abſtinence riſe in me, before my gluttony fall, and therefore I muſt firſt ſuffer my ſelfe to die, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſhall riſe againe with Chriſt, <hi>Chryſostome</hi> ſaith, That in the houſe of God, there is neuer no riſing of vertues, if there be not firſt in her a fall of vices: wherof it followeth, that if thou wilt haue wholeſome vertues to grow in thee, thou muſt firſt of neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pull all ſuperfluous paſsions out of thee. S. <hi>Barnard</hi> ſayth, That the ſonne of God came into the world for the fall &amp; ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of many, ſeeing that pride fell with his humility, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe with his pouerty, anger with his patience, the fleſh with his chaſtity, gluttony with his abſtinence, and alſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance fell with his doctrine. <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> ſaith, That the ſonne of God came into the world, <hi>in ruinam &amp; reſurrectione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the prowd ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth humble, the couetous ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pitiful, the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious man meeke, the carnall man chaſt, the gluttonous abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and the cold man deuout, in ſo much that there is in the ſame man a fall of vices, and a riſing of vertues.</p>

What thing more ſtrange, or what
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:3666:105"/>more grieuous newes can be told a holy and vertuous woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, than to tell her from God that her ſonnes ſword ſhal part her heart in two? <hi>Abraham</hi> tooke a knife for his ſonne <hi>Iſaac,</hi> but hee killed him not. <hi>Balaam</hi> met with an Angell which had a knife, but he ſtroke him not: <hi>Ioſue</hi> ſaw another Angell with a drawne ſword, but he did not ſet vpon him, and <hi>Salamon</hi> tooke a knife to cut a child in two, but in the end he did not part him in two. What meaneth this mother of God, what meaneth this? <hi>Abrahams</hi> knife did not hurt his ſonne, and thy ſonnes ſword woundeth thy hart. <hi>Balaam</hi> did not hurt his Aſſe with his ſword, and doth not thy ſonnes ſword fauour thy heart? <hi>Ioſue</hi> his ſword doth offer and threaten but hurteth not, and doth thy ſonnes ſword wound but not threaten? Had <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> knife pitie on the ſtrumpets child, and had not thy ſons knife pitie on his owne mother? Hee placed a Cherubin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Paradiſe, and a firie ſword to keepe the way of the tree, ſaith the holy Scripture in the fourth chapter of Geneſis. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that our firſt Parents had tranſgreſſed the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, our Lord put there preſently a firie ſword to keepe Paradiſe, becauſe no man ſhould enter in, to eat of the tree which was forbidden. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> vpon this place ſaith, That there was neither ſword nor knife in the houſe of God, before that man knew what ſinne was, but at the ſame houre that he fell from grace to ſinne, our Lord put both ſword and gibbet in his houſe. Before that man ſinned, there was no dore to ſhut in the houſe of god, nor Cherubin to watchit, nor ſword to defend it: but immediately after man ſinned, the gate was ſhut, and the key was loſt. What is the ſword which we ſpeak of here, but onely the ſonne of God in whom wee beleeue? The ſonne of God is called a ſword in the Apocalips, and a ſword vvhich cutteth on both ſides, becauſe hee alone and no other puniſheth the bad and defendeth the good, killeth thoſe which are aliue, and raiſeth thoſe vvhich are dead. It vvas in the hands of the Cherubine to let vs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in or not, into the terreſtriall Paradiſe: and it is in the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:3666:106"/>hands of the ſonne of God, vvhether wee ſhal enter into the celeſtiall Paradiſe or not. Wee haue a greater and a better watch in our Paradiſe, than <hi>Adam</hi> had in his, becauſe that the Cherubin did but ſtand at the gate, but the ſonne of God is the gate it ſelfe. When he ſaid I am the gate, what did hee mean elſe, but that he was the key with the which we ſhould open, he was the gate through the which we ſhould enter in, and he the guide which ſhould direct vs, and he the Paradiſe which we ſhould enioy. It is alſo to bee noted that the ſword with the which the Cherubin kept Paradiſe, was neither of ſiluer nor gold, nor yron, but was of pure fire, which is a new and an vnuſuall thing which no man would beleeue if it were not in Scripture. It is a thing often tried for yron to haue fire in it, and for yron to bee in fyre: but that a fyre ſhould bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a ſword, is neuer read but of that ſword which kept Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe. To apply the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the figure vnto the thing figured, al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are as it vvere yron ouercaſt with ruſt, that is, fallen into original ſinne, or actuall great or ſmall, the ſword of the liuing God excepted, in vvho<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there was neuer found any ſin, nor the ruſt of any fault, but was alwaies like vnto a ſword of fire, made in the forge of the holy Ghoſt. What was the ſword vvhich kept Paradiſe but onely Ieſus vvhich ſuffered on the croſſe? When thou diddeſt ſay. O my ſweet Ieſus, I come to put fire on the earth, art not thou happily all fire, ſeeing that thou doſt come to put all the vvorld on fire? O how much better the ſword is vvhich the church hath, than that vvhich the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue vſed! Becauſe her ſword did let no man enter into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, but ours doth open the gates vnto vs. What ſhall I ſay more, but that her ſword vvas of fire, vvhich did burn, &amp; ours is but of Loue vvhich giueth comfort? O ſword of holy loue, my ſweet Ieſus, hovv happy I ſhould be if I vvere dead vvith thy knife, becauſe that that killing ſhould bee a riſing from death, that bowelling of me a letting of bloud, my end a nevv beginning, and my dying a liuing. Our Lords mercy is ſuch, that he ſaith not, <hi>Ego mortifico,</hi> but he ſaith I doe giue life: nor

Then our Lord doth mortifie vs, when he killeth our inclinations in vs, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are ſtroken with his hand, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are puniſhed with his great mercy, and like a good ſurgeon hee neuer ſeareth the quicke fleſh, but the rotten member which infecteth the reſt. And becauſe <hi>Simeon</hi> ſaith, that the dolours and the ſword of her ſonne went through the mothers heart, it is expedient for vs to ſtay ſomewhat in declaring the greifes which Chriſt ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, becauſe that thereby we ſhall know them, which he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted vnto his mother. <hi>Cum eſſet Dauid in ſpelumca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Obdollam, conuenernat ad eum omnes qui erant in anguſtia, &amp; oppreſsi aere alieno,</hi> ſaith the Scripture 1. Reg. 22. as if he would ſay, When king <hi>Dauid</hi> hid himſelfe in the den of Obdolla, there came vnto him all ſuch as were baniſhed by the order of iuſtice, or fled for debts; of all which ſorrowfull <hi>Dauid</hi> was the Prince and captaine, for of all the afflicted he was the moſt afflicted. This is a high figure, and deepe myſtery, worthy of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, becauſe in it is figured very much by <hi>Dauid,</hi> and namely the great griefes which Chriſt endured. O that it were farre better for me poor ſinner which write this, that my ſoule did taſt of them, than for my fingers to write them! Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the doctrine which the ſonne of God teacheth is of that quality, that although it bee very good to preach it, yet it is farre better to follow it. There were many figures of Chriſt in the old law, but none ſo liuely as <hi>Dauid</hi> was: in proof whereof, they did not call Chriſt the ſonne of <hi>Adam,</hi> nor the ſonne of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> but the ſonne of <hi>Dauid,</hi> partly becauſe hee was of his princely Tribe, partly becauſe he was not ſo liuely figured in any as in him. God ſaid vnto <hi>Dauid</hi> by ſpecial priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, I haue found a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> according vnto my own hart, &amp; the Father ſaid of Chriſt only, this is my welbeloued ſonne, in ſo much, that that loue which God bare in times paſt vnto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> was figured afterward in the loue which hee bare to his
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:3666:107"/>deere beloued ſonne. <hi>Dauid</hi> was alſo a figure of the ſonne of God in that, that as <hi>Dauid</hi> was perſecuted by his maiſter the king of Iſrael without cauſe, euen ſo Chriſt vvas perſecuted of the Iſraelites, not hauing offended them at all: inſomuch that if <hi>Saul</hi> did perſecute <hi>Dauid</hi> of pure enuy, the Iewes did perſecute Chriſt of pure malice. <hi>Dauid</hi> was alſo a figure of Chriſt in the denne of Obdollam, where if Chriſt had been, <hi>Dauid</hi> had neuer beene the captaine and prince of all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and baniſhed men, but the ſon of God had been their ringleader, as hauing endured more griefe and vexation than all they, becauſe he did exceed all heatheniſh gods in power, and all the Angels in merite, and all the Martyrs in ſuffering. King <hi>Dauid</hi> vvas badly handeled by his brothers defied and chalenged by Golias, baniſhed by <hi>Saul,</hi> skoffed at by <hi>Michol,</hi> ſtoned by <hi>Simei,</hi> perſecuted by <hi>Abſalon,</hi> robbed by the Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lechites, vvarred by the Philiſtims, watched by the Ceilitas, and iniuried by the Ammonites. But notwithſtanding, that king <hi>Dauid</hi> ſuffered many griefes and troubles, yet they may bee numbred. But what ſhall we ſay of thoſe which good Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus endured, which were ſo many in number, that no man is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reckon them, nor yet at all follow them? Being a verifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed matter that king <hi>Dauid</hi> had tenne kindes of people which did perſecute him, &amp; that he had twelue tribes or kingdomes which did obey him, it is now to be knowne who was his ſon vvho inherited his kingdomes, and vvho was his ſonne who ſucceeded him in all vexations and griefes. <hi>Salomon</hi> ſonne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Berſabee</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> ſucceeded him in the inheritance of his twelue kingdomes, vvith vvhome his father left him no warres to maintaine, no enemies to reſiſt him, no ſucceeds to contend with him, no factions to pacifie, nor debts to pay. What did not the good old man leaue his ſonne, conſidering that he left him al his kingdomes in peace, and great treaſures laid vp for him? But vvhen forgetfull <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaw that his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, had left him great ſtore of vvealth and no vvarres, hee beſtowed all that in vices vvhich hee ſhould haue beſtowed
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:3666:107"/>againſt his enemies. King <hi>Salomon</hi> inherited kingdomes and vices, vices and kingdomes, ſeeing hee had threeſcore Queenes crowned to his wiues, and ſeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hundred concubines. <hi>Salomon</hi> did inherite vices and all other daintineſſe, ſeeing he himſelfe doth commend himſelfe, that his eies coueted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which was denied him, nor his heart deſired nothing which he did not obtaine; in ſo much that he did not liue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording vnto that which reaſon did preſcribe him, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto that the fleſh did lead him vnto. Hee vvaſted his fathers treaſures, which hee did inherite, in building ſtately houſes to dwell in, and ſtrong caſtels to retire himſelfe vnto, large orchards to recreate himſelfe in, great pooles to fiſh in, cunning muſitians to ſing to him, ſweet inſtruments to play vpon, and nimble young maids to daunce in his hall. King <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> did inherite great peace and concord from his father <hi>Dauid,</hi> conſidering that in fifty years vvhich hee raigned, hee vvas neuer challenged by any king, hee neuer ſaw enemie in his kingdome, hee neuer placed army in field, there neuer vvent banner out of his pallace, neuer captaine had pay of him, no drum euer brake his ſleepe. <hi>Salomon</hi> did inherite great riches from his father, ſeeing that he couered the Temples with gold, he inherited great power, ſeeing that all the kings of the earth did ſerue him, he inherited great wiſedome, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he neuer erred in matter of iuſtice, hee inherited e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>xcee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding great knowledge, ſeeing that men came to ſee him as a miracle. <hi>Salomon</hi> did inherite from his father more delights and dainties than kingdomes, ſeeing it is not read, that euer he was ſick, that euer he endured any neceſsitie, that any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity did diſquiet him, that any perſecution did afflict him, that any grief did trouble him, that any king durſt offend him, that any kingdome rebelled againſt him, or ſubiect diſobeied him. To conclude, wee ſay that <hi>Dauids</hi> ſucceſſor in his kingdomes was his ſonne <hi>Salomon,</hi> vvhome by excellency they called the rich, the wiſe, and quiet, becauſe that in all his life time, he neuer put hand to ſword, nor neuer ſhed mans bloud. Now
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:3666:108"/>that wee haue told you who ſucceeded <hi>Dauid</hi> in his delights and kingdomes, it is alſo needful that we proue vnto you who was his ſonne which ſucceeded him in his iniuries and greifes: for ſeeing wee haue reioiced with the proſperous, it is reaſon that we ſuffer ſomewhat with the afflicted. <hi>Dauid</hi> was twiſe made a Prince, once in the city of Ebron, where hee was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed king of the twelue Tribes, &amp; ſecondly in the denne of Obdollam where hee was made chiefe of thoſe which were in tribulation: and from hence it groweth, that when the time came when hee ſhould deuide theſe two kingdomes betwixt his two ſonnes, he gaue <hi>Salomon</hi> his rich and flouriſhing king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and Ieſus Chriſt his poore afflicted one. Our Lord will giue him his father <hi>Dauids</hi> ſeat, ſaid the Angel vnto the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, as if he would ſay, Thou art to vnderſtand O high Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that the pledge and dowrie which the eternall father will giue his eternall ſonne, ſhall bee the ſeat of his old father <hi>Dauid,</hi> the ſeat I ſay, not of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but to be iudged, nor the ſeat of commanding, but of obeying, not of weale but of woe, not of honour but of pouerty, not of pleaſure but of paine. O how the Iudaical natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was deceiued in thinking that Chriſts kingdome ſhould bee a temporall kingdome, and that hee ſhould deliuer them out of their captiuity! For ſeeing that he inherited but one ſeat of his father <hi>Dauid,</hi> how was it poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that he ſhould deliuer the ſynagogue by force of armes? If the Meſsias promiſed in the old law, ſhould bee <hi>Dauids</hi> ſonne, and rich and mighty, why did they not receaue king <hi>Salomon</hi> for their Meſsias, ſeeing that hee inherited from his father armes to deliuer them, power to defend them, treaſure to enrich them, and great wiſdome to gouerne them? How is it poſsible that the ſonne of God who inherited nothing of <hi>Dauid</hi> but a poore ſeat, ſhould make warre vnto any, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer them from ſeruitude? The ſonne of God ſucceeded his father <hi>Dauid</hi> in the ſeat of obedience, which hee had with thoſe who obeied him, in the ſeat of charity which hee had with the diſeaſed, in the ſeat of mercy which he had with the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:3666:108"/>afflicted, the ſeat of humilitie which he had with the prowd, and the ſeat of patience which hee had among the ouertra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled. Chriſt did onely inherite the principality of the afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and comfortleſſe, and was content withall with it, ſeeing that he was baniſhed by <hi>Herod,</hi> ſold by <hi>Iuda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If all the troubles &amp; vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of the world ſhould bee put on one heape, and thoſe which Chriſt alone ſuffered on another, all men would giue him the prime, and to none of the reſt, becauſe that of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men bee they neuer ſo holy, there is no man that feeleth more than his owne griefe and paine; but the ſonne of God did feele his owne, and thoſe of his elect. When the Apoſtle ſaith that the ſonne of God, <hi>Factus eſt omnia nobis,</hi> is made all things for vs, what elſe doth hee ſay, but that hee doth ſuffer with him who ſuffereth, weepeth with him who weepeth, &amp; dieth with him who dieth?

S. <hi>Barnard</hi> ſayth, The God of all creatures, and the Lord of the heauenly gouernements is the true Phiſitian of my griefes &amp; ſorrowes, becauſe all other men haue power only to hear the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but no skill to remedy them. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſayth, If I be a cold, he who wiſheth me vvel, can bring me to the fire, if I be hungry, giue mee a little bread, if I bee thirſty giue mee a cup of vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if I bee naked giue mee a ſhirt, but if my ſoule bee ſad and comfortleſſe, vvhat comfort can he giue me, but only bid me haue patience? S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to the Hermites ſaith, Hee who will comfort the ſoule, ought to be in the ſoule, and he vvho will remedy the heart ſhould dwell in the heart, but becauſe no man hath his abiding there but onely the ſonne of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God, of him and of no other our remedy and eaſe muſt proceed. <hi>Cicero</hi> in an Epiſtle ſaith, O how hee is deceiued which ſaith and thinketh, that the griefes of the heart are le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified and eaſed by ſeeing faire meddowes, vvalking by freſh riuers, eating dainty meats, hearing pleaſant muſicke?

The like prophecy was neuer heard of in times paſt, nor read in any booke, nor any ſo ſorrowfull a prophecie euer ſpoken of, as this was which the Virgine newly deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red heareth this day, which the good old <hi>Simeon</hi> vttereth vnto her: for what ſaith the prophecy, but that at one time, in the ſelfeſame day, in the ſame hour, and with the ſelfeſame ſword, they will doe iuſtice vpon the ſonnes fleſh, and vpon the mothers bowels? There are found ſwords commonly to cut off a theefes eare, to behead a murderer, to quarter a trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, to cut a blaſphemous tongue, but a ſword that can pierce the ſoule, and mind, there is no other to bee found, but this ſword of Chriſts.

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:3666:110"/>wound the body, but alas <hi>Simeons</hi> ſword bruſed the fleſh of the ſonne, and did not fauor the bowels of the mother. <hi>Vber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi> noteth, that <hi>Simeon</hi> doth not ſay, that a ſword of ſorrow ſhall ſtrike thee, but <hi>Pertranſibit,</hi> that is, that that ſword vvill not bee content onely to wound, but as it were with a mortall thruſt ſhall peirce thy bleſſed ſoule, from one ſide vnto the other. And then that deadly ſword peirced her from one ſide vnto the other, when all the ſorrowes and griefes which the ſonnes fleſh endured did load the heart of the dolorous mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with griefe. The wordes of <hi>Auegratia plena</hi> which the Angel vſed, and thoſe which <hi>Simeon</hi> ſpake, <hi>doloris gladius per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranſibit</hi> went togither, and were of equall force: for euen as the Virgines ſoule was ſo full of grace, that ſhe could receiue no more, ſo her heart was ſo full of griefe, that ſhee could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure no more. There could not a greater griefe be ſpoken of than that which the mother was to ſuffer, which was vttered in ſaying that a ſword ſhould pierce her heart from one ſide vnto the other: and indeed as old <hi>Simeon</hi> had prophecied, ſo it came to paſſe, becauſe there was neuer Martyr which ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more torment in the martyring of his body, than the bleſſed Virgine ſuffered in ſeeing her ſon martyred. And this ſpeech <hi>tuam ipſius animam,</hi> is very much to bee noted: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though other holy men were grieued at the death of Chriſt, yet none ſo much as his holy mother: for in other men the griefe was as it were a blow, but in the Virgins heart a thruſt. <hi>Simeon</hi> doth threaten none that the ſword of grief ſhal pierce, but only the mother of Chriſt, to let vs vnderſtand, that as ſhe was the creature vnto whom Chriſt imparted moſt of his comfort, ſo it was ſhe vnto whom he gaue moſt of his dolors, inſomuch that as ſhe did moſt deſerue, ſo ſhe did moſt ſuffer. O great <hi>Simeon</hi> why doeſt thou threaten the mother onely, with the ſonnes ſword, ſeeing that not only the martyrs did feele his death and paſsion, but it ſeemeth alſo that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels themſelues did lament and weepe for it? For what mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr is there in heauen O ſweet Ieſus, which did not feele thy
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:3666:111"/>death, and die for thy holy law? It is therefore ſaid that the holy Virgine did by a ſpeciall grace and priuiledge feele more grieuouſly the death of her ſonne, than any other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the world, becauſe it is a propertie of our Lord to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part moſt bitter feeling of his paſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto thoſe ſoules whom hee doth moſt tenderly loue. When <hi>Simeon</hi> ſaid that ſhee ſhould feele her ſonnes paſsion more than any other, it vvas to ſay, that Chriſt would leaue his paſsion and torment in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping with her aboue others, to the end that they might bee knowne afterward vnto the world: in ſo much that it was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, bleſſed Virgin, vnto whom the ſonne of God beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his greateſt loue on earth, and vnto whome hee imparted moſt of his ſorrowes. Vnto whom then ſhould wee run for a true ſufferer of his ſorrows, but vnto thee O mother of God now full of ioy and conſolation, though then full of ſorrowes and paſsion? O that thy ſoule is glorious, and thy heart moſt happie bleſſed Lady, ſeeing thou was not martyred with the Emperour <hi>Neroes</hi> ſword as the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paule</hi> was, but vvith the ſelfeſame that thy ſonne was; in ſo much that as in the incarnation loue coupled you together, ſo in his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion dolour ſeperated you one from the other. <hi>Flebat Anna mater Tobiae irremediabilibus lachrymis: Tobie</hi> chapter 10, as if hee would ſay, The honourable.

O my ſonne, O my heart, how vnfortunately did I conſent that thou ſhouldeſt depart out of my ſight, conſidering that it vvas moſt certaine, that hauing thee vvith mee, I vvanted nothing! What ſhall my ſorrowfull eies doe now, ſeeing they cannot ſee thee but fill themſelues vvith vveeping for thee? Such ſorrowfull vvords and grieuous complaints, could not be vttered, but of a tender heart, nor could not be ſpoken but of a child deerly beloued. <hi>Mimus</hi> the Philoſopher ſaith, That becauſe, the tongue is a crier and a publiſher of that vvhich is in the heart, it is moſt certaine, that if there bee loue in the hart, that he crieth Loue; and if there be nothing but ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row &amp; griefe in the heart, he publiſheth alſo nothing but ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. For the better vnderſtanding of this dolorous figure, it is to bee noted, that as <hi>Iſaac</hi> vvas the figure of Chriſt in that vvhich hee vvas to ſuffer, ſo <hi>Tobias</hi> mother vvas the figure of that that the immaculate Virgine was to weepe: inſomuch that the virgins glorious martyrdome was prophecied by <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon,</hi> and figured in holy <hi>Anna.</hi> The myſtery did well anſwer vnto the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, ſeeing the bleſſed virgin was a mother, &amp; <hi>Anna</hi> a mother, the one wept &amp; the other wept, the one had but one only ſon, &amp; the other had but one onely ſon, the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines ſon went a far iourney, &amp; <hi>Annas</hi> ſon went a far iourney, <hi>Tobias</hi> mother vvept remedileſſe tears, &amp; the mother of Gods tears were alſo without remedy.

What ſhall I ſay more, but that Chriſt and <hi>Tobias,</hi> and <hi>Tobias</hi> and Chriſt, vvere ſent by their owne fathers, and lamented by their owne mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? O that the Virgine had better reaſon to vveepe for her ſonne vvith remedileſſe teares than <hi>Tobias</hi> mother had, becauſe her ſighes and reares found remedy and
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:3666:112"/>comfort, but the mother of God found no remedy nor comfort. O ſorrowfull vvoman and comfortleſſe mother! for what comfort could thy teares find, ſeeing thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſee him end his life in one day vpon the croſſe, whome thou waſt thirty yeares a bringing vp? O comforeleſſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and mother of diſcomfort, thou art ſhee which ſhould weepe with remedileſſe teares, and not the mother of young <hi>Tobias;</hi> becauſe her ſonne came home well married, but thy precious ſonne remained dead vpon the croſſe. O honourable Anne, and bleſſed old woman, it is an Angell which led him, an Angell which accompanied him, an Angell which marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and an Angell which guarded him, and an Angell which brought him backe againe. Therefore leaue thy teares for her, who is the mother of him which is crucified, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that a traitor ſold her ſonne, a ſinner denied him, a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant condemned him, and a wicked people put him to death. Our Lady wept with remedileſſe tears, ſeeing that ſhe &amp; not <hi>Tobias</hi> his mother did loſe the ſtaffe which did ſupport her, the glaſſe which ſhe looked in, the light with which ſhee ſaw, the reſt wherein ſhe tooke ioy, her only hope and that which ſhee moſt of all loued. <hi>Seneca</hi> to this purpoſe ſayth, That the griefe is not ſo great, when thinges are loſt by little and by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, as when they are loſt all at once: and therefore it is a great matter for a man to bee accuſtomed to endure, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened in ſuffering. Who doth doubt at all but that the ſuddaine loſſes which fall vnto vs, are more grieuous than thoſe vvhich come not all together? if they had apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the ſonne of God in one day, accuſed him on another, giuen ſentence on him the other, and executed him on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, although the griefe could not but haue beene great, yet it had been tollerable; but to ſee that in foure and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty houres they apprehended him, accuſed him, gaue ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence on him, and put him to death, vvhat heart is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſuffer it, or vvhat eies can weepe and bewaile it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently? <hi>Venient tibi has vna die sterilitas &amp; viduitas,</hi>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:3666:112"/>ſaid God by the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> chapter ſixteene: as if hee would ſay, When thou ſhalt leaſt thinke vpon it, there ſhall happen two great miſhaps vnto thee O Synagogue, that is, thou ſhalt bee made a widdow, and alſo barren vvithout a ſonne. The ſpace of three thouſand yeares in which God vvas married vnto the Synagogue, hee raiſed Patriarkes and Prophets continually in her: but vvhen the ſon of God vvas put to death, ſhee vvas put from him like a naughty vvoman, and the Church admitted in her place, in ſo much that from good Friday forward vvhen he died on the croſſe, ſhee neuer after vvas great vvith any gifts or graces, nor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer brought foorth any holy man. Our bleſſed Lord vvas his mothers bridegroome, and deere ſonne alſo, and hee vvas ſo certainely her bridegroome, that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> vvas not more hers vvhen hee vvas betrothed vnto her: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it is, that vvhen <hi>Ioſeph</hi> died ſhee vvas not fully a vvid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, but vvhen the ſonne of God died ſhee was fully a vvid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. Why dooth the Prophet call her a vviddow, but by reaſon of her ſonne vvhich ſhee loſt, and vvhy doth hee call her barren, but by reaſon that ſhee had no comfort and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation? O that the Prophet doth rightly call thee barren, ſeeing that in one day, and in one houre, thou diddeſt loſe thy husband and vvaſt bereaued of thy ſonne! But yet thou maieſt comfort thy ſelfe vvith one thing, O glorious Virgine, that is, that thou needeſt not vveare a mourning vveed, though thou bee a vviddow, becauſe thee very ſtones haue broken in ſunder, and the heauens haue mourned for pure compaſsion. <hi>Magna velut mare eſt contritio tua; quis medebitur tibi?</hi> Sayth <hi>Ieremy</hi> in his Lamentations: as if hee would ſay, thy griefe dooth ſo much exceed all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther griefes, as the ſea doth exceed all other vvaters; becauſe all men can take pitie on thee, but no man remedy thee. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> doth highly ſet forth the dolours vvhich the ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mother ſuffered on the Mount of Caluary by compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her vnto the ſea vvater; becauſe that as there is no drop
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:3666:113"/>of water in the ſea which is not ſalt, euen ſo there was no part of the Virgines heart which did not feele griefe and paine. Hee calleth the Virgines dolour Contrition, that is, a kind of bruſing or breaking: hee calleth it great, and hee calleth it a ſea which is bitter, in ſo much that as there is nothing which can bee compared to the ſea in greatneſſe, euen ſo there is no griefe which can bee compared vnto the griefe which the Virgine ſuffered. There are ſome griefes and ſorrowes, the which if they bee bitter, yet they are not great, and if they bee great, yet they are not bitter: but the Virgines dolour vvas the greateſt in the world, for it was ſo bitter, that there could bee none ſo bitter, and ſo great that none could bee greater. What could bee more bitter, ſeeing it went to her heart, what longer ſeeing it continued all her life time? O that thy contrition was great like vnto the ſea: for as there is in the ſea both calme and tempeſt, ſo was there in thy heart at one time ioy and ſorrow; ioy in ſeeing thy ſonne redeeme the world, and ſorrow in ſeeing thy ſonne die vvithout iuſtice. What ſorrow doeſt thou thinke ſhould that heart feele, in the which at one time there did ſtriue ſenſuality and reaſon, loue and feare, liking and diſſiking, willing and nilling? What ſea can bee compared in depth, or what water in bitterneſſe, vnto the heart in the which is forged at one time, a will to redeeme all the world, and a will that her ſonne ſhould not ſuffer? For as the ſea is deepe, and large, ſo the Virgines griefe was deepe, becauſe it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vnto the heart, and great becauſe it vvas of a great matter, and bitter becauſe it was the greateſt griefe in the world. <hi>Barnard</hi> ſayth, That as in the ſea one waue followeth another, and when they are come to the banke, they breake againſt it: euen ſo in the Virgines mind one ſorrow ouerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth another, and one grief ouerreacheth another, the which both together breake againſt the Virgines bowels. And ſhee ſuffered all theſe anxieties and ſorrowes alone, becauſe there was none who might take part of them with her, nor any man
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:3666:113"/>able to giue her remedy for them. <hi>Quis medibitur tibi?</hi> as if <hi>Ieremy</hi> would ſay, O ſorrowfull mother, and comfortleſſe La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, what Phiſition is able to cure thy wounds, hauing them, as thou haſt them, ſo farre within thy heart? Who ſhall cure thee O thou of all other the moſt comfortleſſe, becauſe the griefes of the heart are ſuch, that although they are eaſie to bee reckoned, yet they are hard to bee cured? Who ſhall heale thee O bleſſed Ladie, ſeeing thy carefull loue is of ſuch qualitie, and the wounds of thy ſorrow ſo great, that no man can gueſſe at the curing of them, but hee alone who was the cauſe of them? Who ſhall eaſe thee of all others the moſt deſolate, ſeeing that the Phiſitian which cured the dolours of the heart, is now crucified among theeues and malefactors? Who ſhall cure thee O bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, or who ſhall make whole thy ſorrowfull heart, but hee onely in whome thou haſt put it, ſeeing wee know that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <hi>Gallen</hi> and <hi>Hypocrates</hi> can purge the humors, and let the vaines bloud, yet they cannot cure the griefes of the mind? Who ſhall eaſe thy ſighes but only he for whome we ſigh for? Who ſhall heale thee O my good Ladie, ſeeing that hee is dead on the altar of the croſſe, for whome thou doeſt weepe, and hee hath yeelded vp the ghoſt for whome thou doeſt ſigh? Who ſhall heale thee O my ſinfull ſoule, if thou haſt loſt Chriſt and fallen from grace? Thou muſt now know, that thou haſt no recompence for ſo great a loſſe. Ioine therefore O my ſoule with our Lady and weep with her, ſhee for her ſonne, and thou for thy loſſe, becauſe that after his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection he may comfort her and helpe thee.</p>

The ſcripture doth not ſay only, that ſhee did ſtand hard by the croſſe, but addeth further, <hi>iuxta crucem Ieſu,</hi> by the croſſe of Chriſt, to diſtinguiſh the croſſe of Chriſt from the croſſe of theeues: for it had been no matter whether a man had been on foot, or ſitting by thoſe croſſes. Who ſhould come to the croſſe of Chriſt crucified, but he who is alſo crucified? And hee who will come to the croſſe, muſt liue like vnto them that are on the croſſe, vpon which they know nothing but how to ſuffer, heare blaſphemies, conſent to haue themſelues nailed, ſee themſelues crucified, ſuffer themſelues to bee pierced with a ſpear, yea and not reſiſt to die. Who be they which ſit by the theeues croſſes, but other theeues? By the croſſes of theeues doe ſit impatient men chiding, couetous men a deceiuing, gluttons a eating, libidenous men a playing the adulterers, malicious men a lying, and ſlothfull men a taking their eaſe. It was a croſſe by which Chriſts poore familie ſtood, and they were croſſes by which ſouldiors of the deuill ſtood, to let vs vnderſtand, that they ſuffer more croſſes and paines vvhich goe to hell, than thoſe which go to heauen. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, That if thou wilt ſee who they are which doe ſaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues, and what multitude they bee, which condemne themſelues, thou maieſt ſee it by that, that by the croſſe of Chriſt there ſtood but a few perſons; and by the croſſes of the theeues there were a thouſand people and more, in ſo much that it is in thy choiſe either to goe vveeping a foot to heauen, or goe ſitting and laughing to hell. <hi>Anſelmus</hi> vpon the myſtery of the croſſe ſaith, On the Mount of Caluary there were very many which looked on the croſſe of Chriſt a farre off, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few which ſtood neere vnto it: and the reaſon is, becauſe
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:3666:114"/>that by the croſſe of Chriſt it is not permitted that any ſhould ſinne, and by the croſſes of the theeues, it is lawfull for euery man to ſteale and ſinne. O my ſoule, and O my heart, why doeſt thou not melt, and yeeld vp the ghoſt, ſeeing the drops of bloud which deſcend vpon our Lady, and the ſighes of our Lady which aſcend vnto our Lord? Doeſt thou not marke O my ſoule, doeſt thou not marke how the ſorrowfull mother is bathed with the bloud which runneth from her ſonne, and how the earth is watered with the teares which fall from her eies? <hi>Barnard</hi> ſayth, What offences can there bee ſo great in the world, which the bloud of the ſonne cannot remedy, and the teares of the mother cannot waſh away? Behold O my heart ſaith <hi>Bonauenture,</hi> and thou ſhalt ſee the ſonne vpon the croſſe, and the mother at the foot of the croſſe, ſhee is on foot, and he lifted vp, ſhe holdeth her peace, and he ſpeaketh no word, and that which is moſt of all, they looke vpon one the other with their eies, and vnderſtand one another vvith their hearts. O my fingers and you my pennes, giue ouer vvri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting I pray you, becauſe I may meditate the better how the mother ſaw her ſonne ſhed drops of bloud, and the ſonne ſaw the mother ſhed teares from her heart. What hearts ſhould they haue which had ſuch eies? Who can write this and not ſigh, and who can read it, and not be heauy for it, that is, how the mothers heart was full of griefe for that which ſhee ſaw, and the ſons heartful of loue for that which he ſuffered? And by that meanes there was a cruell debate betwixt the ſorrow of the mother and the loue of the ſonne. Note well (ſayth <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertinus</hi>) that he who was vpon the croſſe, and thoſe vvhich were neere the croſſe, they were all ſtanding, and none ſitting, which is to giue vs vnderſtanding of the ſweet taſt of the croſſe, and of the high myſteries contained in him, whereof hee did impart none vnto thoſe which leaned or ſate at their eaſe, but vnto thoſe which ſtood on their feet. <hi>Non coques hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum in lacte matris,</hi> Deutronomy, chap. 24. as if he would ſay, Let no man bee ſo bold as to ſeeth the fleſh of the kid in the
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:3666:115"/>milke of his damme, but let them eat the goats milke by it ſelfe, and eat the kid by himſelfe, and the law did permit the damme to be milked, and the kid to be killed. If there vvere no other myſtery in this, what did God care whether the kid were ſod in his mothers milke or not? <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith, If it be wel noted, the law doth forbid the kid to bee ſod in the milke of the goat, but the law did not forbid to ſeeth the goat in the bloud of the kid. In which myſtery he did let vs vnderſtand, that the holy mother the church was to be ſod, &amp; ſaued in the bloud of Chriſt, and not Chriſt in the bloud of the church. On that diſmall and vnluckie day, vpon the high Mount of Caluary, the goat and the kid met together, which vvere Chriſt and his mother, in which place againſt all reaſon and law, they did at one time ſeeth the ſon in the mothers milke, and the mother in the ſonnes bloud. From whence iſſued out the bloud, but out of the vaines of the ſonne, and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence came the milke, but from the mothers eies? O goodneſſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer hard of before, O vnſpeakable ſorrow! who did euer ſee or heare of a mother who ſhed ſo many tears, as were inough to bath her ſonne in them, or of a ſonne from whom came ſo much bloud, as was inough to ſeeth his mother in? It appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth well, that they vſed themſelues like mother and child, and that they loued like bride and bridegroome, ſeeing ſhee gaue him diſtilled teares, and hee gaue her ſtrained bloud. <hi>Barnard</hi> in an Homily ſaith, O of all women moſt bleſſed, O mother of my dolours, vvhat ſonne had euer ſuch a mother as he had, or what mother had euer ſuch a ſonne as thou haſt, ſeeing thou diddeſt conceiue him being a Virgine, brough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt him forth with ioy, broughteſt him vp with milke, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſt him with ſweats, and buriedſt him with teares? What could ſhe doe more for him, than follow him with infinit tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell and paines, and bury him with remedileſſe teares? And what could hee doe more for her, than chuſe her for his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and redeeme her vvith his bloud? <hi>Anſelmus</hi> vpon the Conception ſaith, That from the beginning of the vvorld
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:3666:115"/>vntill this day, there was neuer milke better paied for, than that which Chriſt ſucked of his mother: for if ſhee gaue him milke out of hir precious breaſts, hee gaue her bloud out of his holy members. Who euer heard before, or ſaw bloud pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for milke, or milke for bloud? Who can eſtimate or ſet a price on the bloud which ſtreamed from the ſonne, or of the tears which ran from the mother? O good Ieſus, O redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of my ſoule, had it not beene better for thee, and leſſer griefe for thy mother to haue ſod thee in the milke of her breaſts, rather than in the tears of her eies? What canſt thou aske more of her, or what hath ſhee more to giue thee, ſeeing ſhe gaue thee milke when thou waſt borne, griefes and ſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all thy life time, and teares when thou diddeſt die? It had been leſſer hurt for her, and leſſer grief vnto thee to haue giuen thee rather milke than teares, becauſe the milke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth running from the vaines, and the teares come ſtrained from the heart. For who weepeth but weepeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the heart? <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith, That a man may talke and do his buſineſſe being at quiet: but only a grieued and troubled heart weeepeth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are none more certainer witneſſes of the ſorrows which wee ſuffer, than the teares which wee weepe with our cies.</p>

God ſpake theſe wordes vnto the Iewes which vvere hunters; as if he would ſay, If any man goe to the fields a hunting, and by chance meet with a Sparrowes neſt, he may take the young ones, ſo as he let the old one goe, in ſo
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:3666:116"/>much that he ſhould neither take her, nor much leſſe kil her. What other thing is it to goe a hunting for Sparrowes neſts, but to ſeeke out diuine bookes? <hi>Origen</hi> ſayth, Who or what is the neſt but the booke, what the Sparrow but the letter, &amp; which the young ones but the ſences, and who the hunter but the Chriſtian which occupieth himſelfe in holy Scripture? When God commaundeth the hunter to leane the mother, and take the young ones, he doth plainly aduiſe vs, that wee ſhould leaue the letter in the neſt of the holy Scripture, and take the meaning. Hee doth leaue the Sparrow in the neſt which careth not for that which the letter ſoundeth, but for that which the holy Goſpell ſaith, Becauſe there bee ſome ſuch obſcure phraſes in ſcripture, that they are not onely not to be taken as they ſound, but alſo that not to be done which the very letter commandeth. When Chriſt ſayth, If thy eie doe ſcandalize thee, it was not his meaning that wee ſhould pull out our corporall eies which we ſee with, but the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all with the which we damne our ſelues; for Chriſts ſweet law doth command no man to teare his own members, but to pul out ſinnes by the root. When wee loue a child well, wee ſay that wee loue him like our owne eies, and thereupon Chriſt ſaith, if any of thy eies doe ſcandale thee, pull him out. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, That all the Synagogues perdition conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth, becauſe that in the neſt of the Scripture, they take the mother, and leaue the young ones, that is, they take the letter as it ſoundeth, and take not the ſence which is hidden vnder it, making more account of the drie barke, then of the tender marrow. When the Apoſtle ſaith, that the letter killeth, and that it is the ſpirit which doth giue life, what elſe doth he ſay, but that we ſhould take heed of taking the old Sparrow, and that wee ſhould take the young ones which vvas the ſence? When the ſonne of God ſaith, Search the ſcriptures, he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not that we ſhould read the bookes only, but that vvee ſhould ſeeke out the true ſence thereof. If wicked <hi>Arrius</hi> had ſearched out the meaning of thoſe words, My father is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:3666:116"/>than I am, &amp; of thoſe other words, That they may be one as I and my Father are one, there ſhould neuer ſo many good men haue been perſecuted, nor ſo many ſcandales haue riſen in the church by it. Seeing that all liuing beaſts are created for mans vſes and ſeruice, if our Lord had meaned no other matter in the ſparrowes neſts, then the letter ſpeaketh of, hee would neuer haue bidden vs eat of the one, and not touch the other. It had beene a greater loſſe to the Commonwealth to kill fiue or ſixe young ones, than one old one: but becauſe the giuer of the law did intend rather the myſtery, which was ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in the ſparrowes, than the prohibition which hee made when he commanded the young ones to be taken, &amp; the old one to bee let louſe. Conformably then vnto that which our Lord commandeth, let the curious Reader leaue the letter and take the true ſence: otherwiſe it were better for him not to read the Scripture, than vnderſtand it as the Synagogue doth. To come then vnto our purpoſe, what is the neſt but the holy croſſe of Chriſt? Who the ſparrow but our bleſſed Lady? And who the young one but her precious ſonne? <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiel</hi> ſaw a neſt put vpon a high tree, in which neſt euery bird laid an egge, and in the neſt of the croſſe of Chriſt, all the Saints lay their egges, that is, then good deſires, of which the ſonne of God like a good Henne, of euery one gathereth his good worke. According vnto the old law the young ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes might bee taken and killed, and ſo they did by Chriſt: and wherefore then was his poore mother ſo grieuouſly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented there, who was figured in the ſparrow, ſeeing ſhe was exempted by law? O wicked Ieruſalem, and curſed Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue! ſeeing that in the neſt of the croſſe, thou diddeſt find the old bird and the yong, why art thou not content to kil the young one, but doeſt alſo torment the mother? O holy tree, O precious neſt, O bleſſed ſonne, O comfortleſſe mother, what heart could deſtroy that holy neſt, in the which all the holy Trinitie was incloſed? In the high neſt of the croſſe, the father was he who commanded the ſonne to ſuffer, the holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghoſt which aſsiſted, the fleſh which died, the foule which
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:3666:117"/>gaue life, and the bloud which redeemed vs. All this neſt was ouerthrowne by the Synagogue, vvhen his bloud lay vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, his carkaſſe on the croſſe, his fleſh in the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, his ſoule in ioy, and his diuinity vnited to all. What ſhal we ſay of his ſorrowfull mother, of whoſe heart there was one peece on the ground with his bloud, another on the croſſe vvith his skin, another in the ſepulchre with his body, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in hell whither Chriſt went with his ſoule, &amp; another on the Mount of Caluary vvith thoſe of her family vvhich wept? What elſe ſhal I ſay O my ſoule, but that into how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts her ſon was ſcattered, the ſorrowful mothers heart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo many was deuided? <hi>Vbertinus</hi> ſaith, That the doleful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers hart was ſcattered &amp; deuided &amp; deuided again; becauſe that louing her ſon as ſhee did better than her ſelfe, ſhee kept the leaſt part of her heart vnto her ſelfe. Why doe I ſay that ſhee kept ſome part of her heart vnto her ſelfe, ſeeing that all her heart liued and died with her ſonne? If the heart doe run to deſire that which the cies behold, and if whither the heart goeth there goeth alſo the very bowels to continue, where was all the Virgines heart, but in her ſonne whom ſhe beſt beloued? Becauſe the dolefull mother had no other ſonne but him, all her loue was fixed in him, and becauſe the Iewes found the Sparrow and her young one in the neſt of the Croſſe, they crucified the fleſh of Chriſt, and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the mothers heart. Saint <hi>Barnard</hi> ſayth, That if the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines breaſts had been opened in that ſorrowfull houre &amp; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable day, it is religiouſly to bee thought, they might haue found her heart of fleſh, but not the force and vigour of a heart, becauſe her vitall ſpirits had mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and her true loue buried it vvith her ſonne. O mighty Redeemer, and ſupreme Creator, vvho is able to tell the ſecret, or reach vnto this, that is to ſay, why thou diddeſt take the mother vvith thee thither, to ſee thee die in that great and high day of thy paſsion, and leaue all thy other diſciples behind thee, becauſe they might not ſee thee ſuffer? In ſo great a conflict, and ſo narrow a ſtraight as
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:3666:117"/>this was vpon the Mount of Caluary, why wouldeſt thou haue rather wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with thee to weep, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to defend thee? Who but thou O good Ieſus (ſaith S. <hi>Barnard</hi>) who but thou did euer goe into the field to fight againſt his enemies with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out weapons, &amp; accompanied with tears? The mother wept, the ſonne wept, the kinſman wept, the diſciple wept, the aunt wept, all the family wept, ſo that <hi>Moyſes</hi> did drowne his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in waters, and the ſonne of God his with teares. <hi>Anſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> ſayth, That hee that could haue beene at the death of Chriſt vpon good Friday ſhould haue ſeene the Iewes make an outcry, the Phariſies blaſpheme, the hangmen lay on, the heauens vvaxe darke, and all the faithfull weepe, in ſomuch that there was nothing in the ſynagogue but blaſphemies, and nothing in the church but teares. <hi>Non immolabitur vna die o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uis cum filio fuo,</hi> ſaid God in Leuiticus, chap. 22. As if he would ſay, Let thoſe take heed which will offer to the Tabernacle, that they doe not kill the lambe and the ewe the ſame day. <hi>Origen</hi> ſayth, That becauſe our Lord is mercifull, hee would haue his diſciples bee ſo likewiſe, and therefore he did forbid them any thing that might tend vnto cruelty, or induce them vnto it. What can be more cruell than to take the lambe and the owe at one time? Who is the ewe which hath brought forth the lambe, but only the mother of Chriſt, and who the lambe but her precious ſonne? God did warn the ſynagogue often that they vvould take heed vnto the Lambe and ewe, and eſpecially that if they would touch the ſonne, that they vvould pardon the mother. God had no greater wealth nor any equal neither in heauen nor in earth, vnto that lambe and ſheep, of whom he himſelfe had a care, and in whoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice and guard all the powers of heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were by him emploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This commandement was broken on the Mount of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uary, where they at one time, killed the innocent lambe, and ſpared not the ſorrowfull mother. What cruelty and inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie like vnto this was euer ſeen or heard of, haung but one ſheep in the Synagogue, &amp; the church hauing but one lamb, to kill the lambe in the preſence of his mother, and torment
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:3666:118"/>the ewe in the ſight of the Lambe? What equall torment could there bee to the mother than to kill her ſon before hir face, or what greater martyrdome could the ſon ſuffer, than to ſacrifice his mother in his ſight? O how glorious and happy ſhould I be if my ſoule would turn to be ſuch an ewe, and my heart ſuch a lambe, becauſe I might bee ſacrificed on the Mount of Caluary with the true Lambe! O ſweet Ieſus (ſaith <hi>Vbertinus</hi>) O mercifull Lord, ſeeing that all lawes doe ſpeake in fauour of thy precious mother, why wouldeſt thou breake them, ſeeing thou art the iudge of them all? Is not the law made in the fauour of thy mother, which commandeth that the lambe ſhould not bee ſod in the milke of his damme? Is not that law made in the fauor of thy mother, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to take the yong Sparrows, and let the old one go? The law which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth not to kill the Lambe and the ewe at one time, is it not made in fauour of thy mother? Thou then, that art the giuer of the law, doe not breake the law; which thou doeſt, if thou ſacrifice thy ſelfe which art the lambe, and thy mother which is the ewe. There is bloud inough in the bloud of the lamb, &amp; there needeth not the bloud of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for if it be neceſſary for the ſon to die to redeeme vs, the mothers life is alſo neceſſary to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort vs. <hi>Bonauenture, Anſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Vbertinus,</hi> cannot wonder inough what ſhould bee the reaſon why the ſonne would take his mother with him to the foot of the croſſe, ſeeing that ſhee could not helpe him in his death, nor hee had no need of her to redeeme vs. It is not to bee thought that hee brought her thither without cauſe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſhee did goe thither vvithout ſome myſtery, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that all things done betwixt the ſonne and his mother ſhould bee eſteemed as a myſtery of myſteries, like vnto <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomons</hi> Canticles, which are ſongs of ſongs. The reaſon why our good Ieſus would take his mother with him, was (as <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelmus</hi> ſayth) Becauſe hee would leaue her his onely inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trize, as being the next of kindred. O my ſingers, O my heart, how is it poſsible for you to bee able to write, or my tongue able to ſpeake of the wealth which the ſonne leaueth, or of
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:3666:118"/>the inheritance which the mother doth inherite? But what could hee leaue vnto his mother who was borne in Bethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem among beaſts, &amp; died on the Mount of Caluary betwixt theeues? What can his ſorrowfull mother inherite of him who ſhrowdeth himſelfe in a borrowed ſhrowd, and burieth himſelfe in another mans ſepulchre? What could hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath by Teſtament, who hauing two coats, gaue one to the hangmen which crucified him, and the other to the knights vvhich kept him? What could hee leaue vvho neuer had a foorme to ſet downe on, nor a boulſter to lay his head on? The inheritance then which ſhe did there inherite from her ſonne, was the bloud which there hee ſhed, and the dolours which hee there ſuffered for all men, ſo that with the bloud which came downe from the croſſe, hee watered her body, and with the dolours which hee ſuffered, hee martyred her ſoule. Saint <hi>Barnard De paſsione domini</hi> ſaith, That in ſo great and high a work as this was, and in ſo narrow a ſtrait as this which Chriſt was in, it was very neceſſary that the Virgine ſhould bee there, and giue her ſonne part of all that was in her, not onely to haue compaſsion on him, but alſo to ſuffer with him. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> vpon the paſsion of our Lord ſayth, That becauſe the great prophecy of <hi>Simeon</hi> was not as yet accompliſhed, it was done by the permiſson and counſell of the holy ghoſt, that the mother ſhould be with the ſonne on the Mount of Caluary, where at one time the ſword of grief bereaued the ſon of his life, and pierced the mothers ſoule. As it was not reaſon (ſaith <hi>Anſelmus</hi>) that the mother of God ſhould want the crowne and reward of martyrdome, ſo was it not reaſon that ſhe ſhould be put into tyrants ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, &amp; therfore it was giuen her as a meane, that becauſe ſhee had ſerued her ſonne with exceſsiue loue, her own ſonne ſhould martyre her with his inſpeakable griefs. Who euer ſaw or heard, that as it were at one ſound and after one meaſure, the hangmen ſhould martyrize the ſon, &amp; the ſon martyrize his mother. S. <hi>Barnard</hi> vpon thoſe words, <hi>Maior eſt iniquitas mea,</hi> which <hi>Cain</hi> ſpake, ſayth thus: O good Ieſus that, that charity is greater vvhich
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:3666:119"/>thou diddeſt vſe, than that which thou diddeſt command me O redeemer of my ſoule, ſeeing that on the Mount of Calua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Friday which thou diddeſt ſuffer vpon the croſſe, thou diddeſt not only put thy owne life for vs, but alſo thy bleſſed mothers. When didſt thou condemne thy ſelfe to die, &amp; not pardon thy mother, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the knife of thy paſsion did take away thy owne life from thee, and pierce thy mothers ſoule? The greateſt matter that the ſorrowfull mother could inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite was ſome thorne fallen from thee, or ſome of thy blood ſhed vpon her, or ſome peece of thy fleſh which ſtucke vpon the croſſe, or ſome of the haires of thy head which were caſt abroad. Shee did alſo inherite the hatred which the people bare vnto her ſonne, becauſe that from that day forward, ſhee was called the mother of him which was put to death, of him which was poſſeſſed with a deuill, of the Southſayer &amp; Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licane. His ſorrowfull mother did inherit alſo all the holy col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the twelue Apoſtles. <hi>Iſichius</hi> vpon Leuiticus ſayth thus: Chriſt tooke his precious mother to the Mount of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uary, becauſe ſhe ſhould be a witneſſe of his paſsion, and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite her with the bloud of our redemption: for to beleeue &amp; hold for a certainty, that we are redeemed, it ſufficeth if the Virgin tell vs that ſhe ſaw her ſon die. The ſon of God came into the world, and paied his father the debt which was due for all the ſinnes of the world, of which paiment his will vvas that his mother ſhould be a witneſſe, becauſe ſhe might giue teſtimony, after his death, how his father was paied, the world redeemed, ſinne at an end, the heauen already opened, and the deuill ouercome.</p>

It is alſo to bee maruelled at, that ſeeing hee did not cal him father, but God, why he did adde this vvord My, ſaying, My God, my God, as though his Father were his God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and not the God of all others. It is alſo very much to be noted, why hee doth rather complaine that his Father had forſaken him, than put him to death: ſeeing that hee knew very well that <hi>Pilate</hi> was not of power to take away his life from him, if his eternall father had not giuen him licenſe to doe it? And although hee did complaine of his Father, vvhy did hee not ſay, My Father why doeſt thou forſake mee, but My God vvhy haſt thou forſaken mee, making account of that vvhich hee hath ſuffered, and not of that vvhich then hee did ſuffer? Although all theſe thinges are eaſily rehearſed, yet they are not eaſie to bee expounded: but becauſe they are diuine ſecrets, and done betwixt diuine perſons onely they paſſe mans capacity, yea the Angels vnderſtanding. To come then vnto the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, it is firſt to bee ſeene vvho complaineth, and vnto whome hee complaineth, vvhereof hee complaineth, and vvhere hee complaineth, and before whome hee complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and vvith vvhat wordes hee complaineth. Hee vvho complaineth is Chriſt: hee vnto whome hee complaineth
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:3666:120"/>is his Father: that whereof hee complaineth is becauſe hee had forſaken him: the place where, was on the croſſe: and hee complained before his mother with theſe words, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee. Theſe are moſt pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full words to heare, and tender to prouoke vs to weepe: for if vve conſider how the ſonne of God ſpake them being nailed vpon the croſſe, his body naked, and his enemies round about him, and that vpon a dunghill, what heart is there that would not breake to thinke on it? Seeing wee know, beleeue, and confeſſe, that Chriſt was true God, and that his father was alſo God, and both were but one God, how can it enter into mans vnderſtanding that one who is God ſhould complaine vpon him who is alſo God? If between one God and another there bee complaints, is it any great matter if men ſometimes fall at ods? Wee ſee it fall out daily, that the ſonne complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of the Father, and one friend vpon another, yea &amp; one man vpon himſelfe, but that Chriſt who is God ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine vpon his father who is God, it is a thing neuer heard of before, nor humane weakeneſſe is not able to conceiue it. For ſeeing no man co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaineth on another but for ſome wrong done vnto him, what grieuance could the eternall Father haue done vnto his ſonne whom he loued ſo well? For ſeeing we know that Chriſt is the ſonne of God and his onely belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſonne, and with whome God hath left all his treaſures in keeping, how is it poſsible that God ſhould haue dealt hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with him, ſeeing that he deſerued it not, neither his father deſired it? According vnto that which we haue ſaid our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is good which way ſo euer wee doe wind our ſelues: for if wee ſay that the father did that vnto his ſonne, which hee ought not, wee can neither ſay it nor affirme it: then if we ſay that the ſonne complained vvithout occaſion, we dare not preſume ſo to ſay, in ſo much that we muſt deliuer the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all fault, and allow the ſonnes complaint to bee good. To vnfold our ſelues of this buſineſſe, it is to bee noted that Chriſt ſaid by the Prophet, <hi>Abinfantia creuit mecum miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio,</hi>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:3666:121"/>Becauſe he began to ſuffer from his childhood, and yet hee neuer complained vntill the time came that hee ſhould die. <hi>Leo</hi> vpon the Paſsion of our Lord ſayth, That the noble mens children of this world crie our preſently when they ſee any trouble come vpon them, and aske for ſuccour: but neuer any man ſaw our Lord open his mouth to complaine, vntill a quarter of an houre before they would pull his heart out of his body. S. <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> vpon <hi>Luke</hi> crieth out &amp; ſayth. What newes is this O redeemer of the vvorld, vvhat news is this? When they lay hands on thee, thou takeſt it quietly, vvhen they blaſpheme thee thou makeſt as though thou vvere deaffe, vvhen they vvhip thee thou doeſt hold thy tongue, whon they doe crucifie thee thou doeſt ſuffer, vvhen they kil thee thou doeſt diſſemble: and yet doeſt thou open thy mind euen as thou art yeelding vp thy ghoſt? Why doeſt thou complaine vpon thy father alone, hauing as thou haſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enemies which haue offended thee, that is, <hi>Iudas</hi> who ſold thee, <hi>Peter</hi> which did denie thee, <hi>Pilate</hi> which g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

O what great myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and deep ſecret this thy complaint doth couer, ſeeing that in ſuch a time, and ſuch a narrow ſtrait, thou doeſt complaine, when all other are woont to pardon their iniuries and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile their enmities, and aske pardon for their offences? <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per &amp; in laboribus a iuuentute mea: exaltatus autem, &amp; humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liatus &amp; conturbatus:</hi> theſe wordes the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſayth in the perſon of Chriſt Pſalme 88, as if hee would ſay, I haue been brought vp in trauails and pouerty from my childhood, and then I was lifted vp, and then made low, and afterward troubled and perſecuted. Thy fears haue made me afraid; and thy angers haue broken vpon me, and thy trauails haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed me about, and they haue compaſſed me about altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as it were a vie, and ouer and aboue all this, thou haſt ſet my friend farre from me, and haſt ſeperated him who was my neighbour farre from me. If wee doe deepely looke into the complaints which the ſonne maketh in this place againſt his eternall Father, wee ſhall find that they are many in number, great in quality, and in reſpect incomparable, cruell in their kind, and vnworthy of him vnto whom they are ſent. <hi>Baſil</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Pſalme ſayth, That ſpeaking like a man, it ſeemeth in humane reaſon that the innocency of good Ieſus did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, neither could it be in the clemency of his good Father, that the diuine pittie ſhould load vpon weake humanity, ſo many torments together, and heape ſo many troubles &amp; vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations. The firſt complaint which the ſonne made againſt his Father is, <hi>Quod pauper &amp; in laboribus ſum a iuuentute mea,</hi> to wit, That he brought him vp poorely from his childhood, he made him liue with hunger, and go like a baniſhed man from place to place. <hi>Cicero</hi> ſayth in an Epiſtle, When a young man doth ſuffer trauails, and endure pouerty, if he bee not a foole and an idiot, he beareth it with a great courage, by remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:3666:122"/>that his Father was poore in the ſame manner: but if his Father had been rich, and now hee himſelfe poore, this is ſuch a misfortune, that there is no patience able to endure it, nor heart which can diſſemble it. What ſhould the ſonne of God thinke when hee remembreth what a rich Father hee had, and that hee did ſpend all his treaſure vpon other mens children, and ſuffer him to goe poorely, naked and a hungred, and ſcorned by all men? The Apoſtle ſpeaking of Gods ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſayth, <hi>Deus qui dines es in omnibus,</hi> as if hee would ſay, Thou art the God only which doth poſſeſſe great riches, and art the Lord which hath many lordſhips, becauſe thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt want nothing thy ſelfe, and to impart much of the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus vnto others. <hi>Gloria &amp; diuitiae in domo eius,</hi> ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, his houſe is full of glory, and there is infinite wealth in his chamber. If God then haue glory for thoſe which are in heauen with him, and bee alſo a father who hath wealth for ſuch as are with him in this world, what was the cauſe why he did not impart ſome of this vnto his ſonne? <hi>Ambroſe</hi> vpon this word <hi>Pauper &amp; in laboribus</hi> ſayth, That moſt ſacred humanity came in pouerty of glory, ſeeing that his Father did not ſuffer his ſoule to impart ſomewhat of his glory vnto his body, and his perſon alſo liued in pouerty, ſeeing hee had nothing proper vnto himſelfe in this life, in ſo much that as the father was rich in all things, ſo the ſonne was poore of all things. <hi>Plato</hi> in his Timaeo ſayth, That although pouerty bee no euill thing in a good man, yet notwithſtanding mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth much abhorre it, becauſe there can none but he be called very fortunate who is able to giue vnto others, neither is there any other very vnfortunate, but hee who muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity aske of others. It is to bee thought that Chriſts huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity did feele his pouerty, and neceſsity which hee endured, aſwel becauſe his father had very much to beſtow vpon him, as for that hee muſt oftentimes aske for that which hee had need of. S. <hi>Bonauenture</hi> ſayth in the life of Chriſt: Chriſt had much a doe to maintaine himſelfe and thoſe of his Colledge:
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:3666:122"/>for ſometimes he asked that which he had need of, and they gaue it him not, and at other times he asked not, and yet they ſent him, in ſo much that there did ſtriue in his tender heart at one time the hunger which hee ſuffered, and the ſhame which he had to aske. Hunger did bid him to aske, and ſhame did bid him to forbeare: in ſo much that there paſſed very few daies in the which his ſtomacke was not very hungry, or his holy face couered with ſhame. <hi>Ginomius</hi> the Philoſopher being asked what pouerty was, anſwered. That pouerty of his owne nature was very euilly conditioned, becauſe it giueth no contentment vnto the perſon in whome it is, no ſauour at the table, no taſt in the cup, no warmth in the gowne, nor any life in the purſe. What contentment can a poore man haue, ſeeing they ſcorne him before his face? What ſauour hath he at his table, ſeeing that oftentimes it is time to haue dined before the fire be made in his houſe? What taſt can he haue in his cup, ſeeing that ſometime hee doth not ſend once a weeke vnto the tauern? What truſt can a poor creature haue in his purſe, ſeeing that his purſe did coſt him more than that which is in it? Chriſt had great reaſon to ſay, that hee vvas brought vp poorely, and with great paine from his infancy, ſeeing that he was borne poore, liued poore, and died poore, inſomuch that as hee was the moſt holieſt of all holy men, ſo was he the pooreſt of all poore men. <hi>Exaltatus autem humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atus &amp; conturbatus,</hi> which is the ſecond complaint which the ſonne maketh of the Father. And it is as if he would ſay, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that my Father hath brought me vp in pouerty, &amp; great miſery, he hath remembred to giue me honour, the better af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward to diffame me, and to exalt mee to throw mee after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards downe, in ſo much that my fame hath beene ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad throughout all this kingdome, and my infamy hath flowne afterward throughout al the world. This is a very pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull complaint, and a very deepe ſpeech, and therefore it is neceſſary for vs to expound it well and read it vvith great heed. <hi>Seneca</hi> in his ſecond booke of Anger ſaith, <hi>Laetiores reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:3666:123"/>fortuna, quos nunquam aſpexit quàm ques aſpexit, &amp; postea deſeruit,</hi> as if he would ſay, It was better with them, and they were more merrier which fortune did neuer exalt, nor neuer thought on, than with thoſe whom fortune had once lifted vp to great honour, and afterward thrown down again. <hi>Boetius</hi> in his firſt booke of Comfort ſayth, <hi>In faliciſsimum genus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunij est hominem fuiſſe faelicem.</hi> As if he would ſay, There is no torment in the world to bee compared vnto that, that when a man doth remember that hee hath beene happy in time paſt, and that he is fallen from that eſtate; becauſe ſuch a mans heart doth bewaile his preſent miſery, and ſigh af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the felicitie which he was wont to enioy. What griefe can he take for honour, who neuer knew what it was? <hi>Macrobius</hi> in his <hi>Saturnales</hi> ſayth, That if wee want any thing, all that we can doe is to deſire it; but if we doe once obtaine it, &amp; then loſe it, the heart is not content with deſiring it only, but doth alſo lament the loſſe of it, becauſe it is a farre greater griefe to loſe that which once we haue enioied, than that which we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer had, although we doe deſire it neuer ſo much. The ſon of God did complaine on his owne father, becauſe he had exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, and afterward throwne him downe, becauſe there was neuer ſonne more honored by his father than Chriſt, nor neuer ſonne ſo much abaſed as Chriſt was afterward on the Mount of Caluary. The better to vnderſtand this ſpeech, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altatus &amp; humiliatus,</hi> wee muſt ſuppoſe, that God did neuer giue nor neuer will giue vnto any thoſe graces and prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nences, which hee gaue vnto his welbeloued ſonne, becauſe there is no creature worthy to receiue them, nor any Angell of that capacity, that he is able to haue them imparted vnto him. The ſonne was exalted by his Father, ſeeing hee gaue him his owne diuine eſſence and power, and in that his fleſh ſhould be vnited vnto that diuine nature, and becauſe the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt was the maker and framer of all that myſtery, and becauſe he ſhould take fleſh of a Virgine, and ſhe remained a Virgine. The ſonne was highly exalted by his father, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that hee gaue him ſo much power vpon earth, as hee
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:3666:123"/>had aboue in heauen. The ſonne of God was highly exalted by his father, conſidering that hee gaue him the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſoule that euer was or ſhall bee created, and gaue him power to caſt out diuels, and authoritie to raiſe the dead, and power ouer al the eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, &amp; alſo gaue him licenſe to pardon ſinnes. The ſonne of God was greatly honoured, when hee gaue him, himſelfe for his father, a pure Virgine for his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, holy <hi>Ioſeph</hi> for his maiſter, the great Baptiſt for his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, the great Euangeliſt for his Secretary, holy <hi>Peter</hi> and Saint <hi>Paule</hi> for his Preachers. Chriſt was highly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by his Father, conſidering that he made <hi>Iohn</hi> baptize him in the riuer of Iordan, and cauſed the holy Ghoſt to bee preſent with him, and his glory to ſhine there vpon him, and openly acknowledge him to bee his welbeloued ſon. Behold then how the ſonne of God was exalted and honoured by his father: but alaſſe as hee endeth his ſpeech with <hi>exaltatus,</hi> he ſayth preſently that he was <hi>humiliatus &amp; conturbatus,</hi> that he was throwne downe and troubled, ſo that according vnto this prophecy the end of his honour was the beginning of his infamy. Chriſt was abiected and abaſed by his father, becauſe that from his young tender infancy, his father began to hold a rigorous hand ouer him: for in the firſt three and thirty years which he liued, he neuer gaue him licenſe to ſhew his power, nor employ his knowledge, nor ſet forth his learning, nor win credite and fame in the world. Chriſt was abiected and made low by his father, ſeeing that of God he made him a man, of eternall temporall, of one that was inuiſible, viſible, and of one that was immortall, mortall, of one who was ſtrong &amp; migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, weake, and of a free man a bondſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The ſonne of God was abaſed and abiected by his father, conſidering how he ſuffered the Phariſies to perſecute him by malice, the Prieſts by enuy, the Scribes by couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the Gentiles through ignorance, and the Synagogue by obſtinacy. Chriſt was brought low and abaſed by his father, ſeeing he gaue his enemies leaue to point at him as if hee had been an enchanter, diffame him as an Idolatour, accuſe him of
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:3666:124"/>blaſphemy, rebuke him of ſedition, and condemne him for a Traitor.</p>

It is a new ſpeech and a grieuous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, to ſay that the father ſhould breake his anger vpon his ſonne, and that hee maketh his ſoule afeard. And therefore it is neceſſary for vs to ſhew what anger is, and how it can be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified that there is anger in God. <hi>Poſsidonius</hi> the Philoſopher being asked what anger was, anſwered, In my opinion anger is nothing elſe but a ſhort and a ſuddaine folly. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> defy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it ſaid, that anger was but a kindeling of the bloud, an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration and mouing of the heart, a forgetting of wit &amp; ſence, and a troubling of the iudgement. <hi>Eſchines</hi> being demanded from whence anger proceeded, ſaid that it proceeded from the heat of the bloud, and of the abundance of choller, and a vapour of the gaule, and fierceneſſe of the heart. <hi>Macrobius</hi> ſayth, That no man ſhould chide with one that chideth, nor with him who is chidden, vntill the cauſe be knowne on both ſides: for the cauſe is not in the anger which wee ſhew in chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but in the iuſtice or iniuſtice of the cauſe for which wee chide. <hi>Seneca</hi> in his firſt booke of Anger ſayth, That the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of an angry man are, not to beleeue his friends, to bee
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:3666:124"/>ſodden in all his buſineſſe, helpe himſelfe with his hands, not to reſpect dangers, ſpeake ſuddenly and maliciouſly, and bee angry for a ſmal occaſion, and admit no reaſon. <hi>Chilo</hi> the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher ſayth, That if any man aske him what hee thinketh of anger, hee will anſwere that it is a thing eaſie to be written of, and eaſie to perſuade, and ſweet to bee counſelled againſt, but very hard to bee bridled. Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> vpon the Pſalme, <hi>Neque in ira tua corripias me</hi> ſayth, That Anger is ſuch a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getous thing, that if wee doe giue it entrance into our will, it doth afterward make our nill of our will. Then wee yeeld our will vnto anger, when wee begin to trouble our ſelues with ſmall matters, and then anger doth that which is not our wil, when in great matters we would not be angry: in ſo much that if wee doe not reſiſt anger in the beginning, we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer or late caſt it out of our houſe. Wee haue ſpoken all this to the end that wee ſhould maruell the more how it ſhould be in God, and how he ſhould bee moued like a man, ſeeing that as there is no man able to take his eternall being from him, ſo there is no man able any way to trouble him. Who ſhould bee able to trouble him, ſeeing wee know that God is a ſpirit, and hath no heart in his breaſt, no bloud in his vaines, no vapour riſing from his gaule, no gaule in his lights, no forgetfulneſſe in his memory, no alteration in his iudgement? S. <hi>Ierome</hi> vpon the Prophet <hi>O ſee</hi> ſaith, That God is ſo wiſe that no man is able to deceiue him, ſo mighty that no man is able to reſiſt him, ſo conſtant that no man is able to mooue him, ſo inuiſible that no man is able to touch them, ſo iuſt that no man is able to oppreſſe him. Then if it bee ſo, that hee cannot bee deceiued, oppreſſed, nor moued, how is it poſsible that any anger ſhould raigne in him, as it doth in a man? When the ſonne ſayth vnto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>In me tranſierunt iraetuae,</hi> hee ſayth plainly, that hee hath vnloaden his great anger vpon him, and hath caſt all his griefes vpon his ſhoulders. For the better vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of this complaint which Chriſt maketh, it is to bee
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:3666:125"/>noted, that for the ſpace of many yeares God had enmities and hatred, and found himſelfe agrieued, moued, and diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed: for at the ſame houre that he created creatures, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels would haue been equall with him, man began to diſobey him, ſinne began to preuaile, and alſo to perſecute his friends. God had three notorious enemies in the world, which are man, the deuill, and ſinne: whereof man went about to lift vp himſelfe in Paradiſe, the diuell to take heauen from him, and ſinne to rule and gouern the whole world. O that theſe were vnſpeakeable griefes which theſe three enemies cauſed God to haue, and their diſobedience toward him exceeding great, heaping daily ſin vpon ſinne, wickedneſſe vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, neuer going about to amend themſelues, nor God to be pacified. Our Lord did diſſemble all kind of diſobedience, and all manner of ſinne, vntill his ſonne came into the world, vpon whoſe humanity hee did ſo fully vnload and vnburden his anger and griefe, as though hee had been the only inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſinne. <hi>Gregory</hi> in his Morals ſayth, That the world is a ſtrong enemy, the deuill a ſtronger, and ſinne the Traitor the ſtrongeſt of all: for if there were no ſinne in the world, God would not bee angry, nor man ſhould not bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, nor the Deuill vvould not goe about ſo dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, neither ſhould there bee any hell for the vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. <hi>Damaſcen</hi> ſayth thus, It dooth vvell appeare that the eternall Father did breake all his anger vpon his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſonne, and that hee did vnburden himſelfe and load all his vvrath vpon his humanitie, ſeeing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his ſonne did take fleſh, hee did nothing but pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, and after that hee died did nothing but pardon. Haue you ſeene ſince God hath broken his anger vpon his ſonne, either the vvorld drowned vvith vvater, as in the floud, or burnt vvith fire, as in Sodome and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morra? Hath there beene ſeene ſince God brake his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger vpon his ſonne, ſuch captiuities as the people of the Iewes vvere in, or ſuch plagues as vvere in Aegypt,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:3666:125"/>or ſuch famine as were in <hi>Dauids</hi> time, or ſuch warres as were in the Machabees time? Chriſt had great reaſon to ſay vnto his father, <hi>In me tranſierunt irae tuae,</hi> ſeeing that hee broke all his anger, and diſcharged all his wrath vpon him. <hi>Eripuit me de inimicu meis fortiſsimis, &amp; ab his qui oderunt me,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaking vnder the perſon of Chriſt: That is, in recompence that my Father hath vnloaden vpon mee all his wrath and anger, he hath deliuered me from my mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt enemies, and hath put from my ſide ſuch of my enemies which did hate mee exceedingly. What doeſt thou ſay O ſweet Ieſus, what doeſt thou ſay? doeſt thou die by the hands of thy enemies, and yet doeſt ſay that thy father hath deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thee from them? My father hath not deliuered me from the deuill, ſeeing that he doth tempt me, nor from the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies ſeeing that they haue accuſed mee, nor from the Scribes ſeeing that they haue diffamed mee, nor from the Gentiles ſeeing that they haue crucified me, but he hath deliuered me from ſinnes which are the ſtrongeſt of all my enemies. Are they not the ſtrongeſt of all, ſeeing they rule and maiſterall? <hi>Auguſtine</hi> vpon the Apoſtles words ſayth, Of three enemies which we haue, ſinne is the ſtrongeſt of them al; becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny holy men, haue gone before vs in old times, vpon whom although the deuill and the world haue had no power, yet notwithſtanding ſin hath had a dwelling place in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there did neuer man liue ſo cleane, who knew not what ſinne was. <hi>Caſsiodorus</hi> ſayth, I for my part, thinke ſinne more mightier than any other enemy, becauſe the world and the diuell can but deceiue me, but wicked ſin can hurt me &amp; damn me. For if there were no manner of ſin in the world, we ſhould need neither gallowes nor ſword. Chriſt onely may ſay, hee hath deliuered me from my enemies, becauſe he &amp; no other was free from ſinne, becauſe all other creatures knew what ſinne was, and all knew what puniſhment for it was. O how happy a man he ſhould be, who could ſay with the Prophet, he hath deliuered me from my ſtrongeſt enemies! for it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:3666:126"/>elſe to ſay that God hath deliuered him from his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but that our Lord hath deliuered him from his ſinnes. The Prophet had great reaſon to call ſinne not only an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but alſo his ſtrongeſt enemy, ſeeing that without other helpe, he threw the Angell out of heauen, caſt <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradiſe, depriued <hi>Iudas</hi> of his Apoſtleſhip, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned all the world to death. Is not ſinne thinke you the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt of all other enemies, ſeeing that hee is able and ſtrong i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to carry mee to hell? The power of my viſible ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my reacheth no further than to take my life from mee, but ſinne the Traitour is an enemy ſo ſtrong, that hee is able to take my life from me, depriue me of grace, caſt me out of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, hurt my ſoule, and condemne mee vnto paine. Who had ſuch enemies as the ſonne of God had; that is, ſo wicked in their cogitations, ſo malicious in their ſpeech, and ſo cruell in their deedes? Were not the laſhes which opened Chriſts ſhoulders very cruell enemies, the nailes which broke his ſinewes, the thornes which tore his temples, and the ſpeare which opened his ſide, and the Synagogue which tooke his life from him? Yet Chriſt called none of all theſe his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, nor did not handle them like his enemies, but only ſins, which hee did not only call enemies, but mighty and ſtrong enemies, giuing vs therby to vnderſtand, that we ſhould hold none for our enemie but onely ſinne. When good king <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaid, <hi>Perſequar inimicos meos &amp; comprehendam illos,</hi> Hee ſpake it not in reſpect of the enemies which perſecuted his perſon, but for ſinnes which did damnifie his ſoule. For ſeeing that good king <hi>Dauid</hi> did pardon <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Simei,</hi> and others his mortall enemies, how could hee counſell vs that wee ſhould perſecute ours? When he ſaith I will perſecute my enemies vntill I deſtroy them, he ſpake of no other enemies but of his ſinnes, the which it is conuenient for vs to perſecute, and caſt from vs. And it is not without a myſtery that hee ſayth <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quar &amp; comprehendam,</hi> Becauſe that as the enemy which is offended, if he be not taken, turneth againe and biddeth vs a
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:3666:126"/>more fierce battaile than hee did before; euen ſo dooth the diuell and ſinne deale with vs, the which if we doe not driue away vtterly from vs, and root out from our hearts, they turn againe againſt vs like vnto moſt mighty and ſtrong enemies. What doth it auaile the huntſman if hee run after the Hare, if he take her not: what doth it is profite thee, if thou run af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſinne and deteſt ſinne, and ſpeake euill of it, if thou doeſt not ouertake ſinne; and what elſe is it to ouertake ſinne, but to ouercome and deſtroy ſinne vtterly? O how many there be which ſay, I wil perſecute my enemies, and how few there bee which ſay, and I haue taken them: for if they caſt out ſinnes to day on one ſide of their houſe, they turne againe to morrow, and knocke at the ring of the dore, and it is opened preſently vnto them.</p>

Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in this place of his Father, that he tooke his friends from him, ſeeing that he ſayth, thou haſt remoued my friends from me, &amp; he complaineth that he took his kinſmen from him, &amp; that hee tooke his acquaintance from him, and at that inſtant when hee vvas in greateſt miſery. This is a pittifull complaint
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:3666:127"/>which the ſonne of God now maketh, becauſe there is no griefe to be compared vnto that, nor no hurt equall vnto the taking away of a mans truſty and faithfull friend. <hi>Horace</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth what hee is able to doe, or what hee hath who hath no friends? To what purpoſe doth he liue which hath no friends? <hi>Mimus</hi> the Philoſopher ſayth, That a man dieth as oft as he loſeth any of his good friends: and ſayth further, that as the body is made of diuers members, ſo the heart of friends: and there vpon it is, that as the body cannot liue without it haue many members, ſo likewiſe the heart cannot liue vvithout friends. They killed <hi>Dauids</hi> greateſt enemy which was <hi>Saul,</hi> and his deereſt friend who was <hi>Ionathas</hi> in one day, and hee was ſo agreeued at the death of his friend, that by turns after hee had wept the death of his friend, hee wept his enemies death alſo. We doe not read that our redeemer did weep for the death of holy <hi>Ioſeph</hi> his maiſter, nor for all the trauails which he eudured in this world; but he wept for the death of <hi>Lazarus</hi> his good friend, whoſe death hee could not endure, but immediately did raiſe from death againe. If <hi>Plutarch</hi> the great Philoſopher doe not deceiue vs, <hi>Plato</hi> came from Aſia vnto Cicilia, for no other cauſe but to ſee <hi>Phocion</hi> the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, who was his deere friend. <hi>Cicero</hi> in his booke of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſayth, That the Philoſophers do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend nothing more vnto vs, nor wiſe men did eſteeme of no riches more than of the conuerſation of their friends, becauſe that without friends it is not lawfull for vs to liue, nor yet very ſure to die. <hi>Ariſtorle</hi> being asked what friendſhip was, anſwered, That it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but one ſoule which ruled two hearts, and one heart which did dwell in two bodies. <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſayth, That ſeeing there is no greater paine than to deale with naughty men, nor no greater comfort than to conuerſe with good men; for my owne part I confeſſe and ſay, that I had rather die vvith him whom I hold for my friend, than liue with him whome I eſteeme my enemie. <hi>Eſchines</hi> the Philoſopher being deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded how one friend ſhould be towards another, anſwered: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:3666:127"/>true friends there is but one yea, and one nay, one liking &amp; one miſliking, one agreeing &amp; one diſagreeing, one wil and one nill, one loue and one hatred. Experience doth teach vs, that how good ſoeuer the bread be yet it mouldeth, and wine becommeth vineger, and garments teare, and fleſh waxeth ſtale, and years paſſe away, but friendſhip alone is that which neuer wearieth, &amp; good conuerſation is that that neuer doth loathe. <hi>Pliny</hi> in an Epiſtle ſayth, If thou wilt be honored, giue honour vnto others; If thou wilt bee ſuccoured ſuccour o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; If thou wilt be loued loue others. For if thou wilt haue a friend, thou muſt either make him or find him: and in that caſe I ſay, that it is better for thee to make him by good turns, than buy him with money. <hi>Peter</hi> of Rauenna ſayth in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of the holy Ghoſt: O what a ſweet thing it is to haue friends to loue, and to loue to bee loued againe: for the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of true friendſhip are, that it feareth no ſword, it drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no arrow, it refuſeth no ſpear, nor eſteemeth not his life, but embraceth death with cheerefulneſſe, rather than make any default in friendſhip. <hi>Iſidorus</hi> ſayth, That the priuiledges of true friendſhip are, that it maketh proſperous fortune more pleaſant, and aduerſe more eaſie, maketh doubtful things cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and fierceneſſe meeke, and maketh that light which is greeuous &amp; heauy. <hi>Hermogenes</hi> ſayth, When thou art in proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity in this world, thou oughteſt to ſuſpect all friendſhip; for thou doeſt not know whether they loue that which thou haſt, or thy ſelfe which doeſt poſſeſſe it: for true friendſhip is not knowne when thou haſt much to giue, but when thou art in neceſsity to aske. Is there (ſaith S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi>) any greater co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation in this miſerable vvorld, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to haue a faithful friend, with whom thou maiſt open thy breaſt, communicate thy ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, diſcouer thy heart, impart thy pleaſures, and giue part of thy griefes? If thou doeſt make a bed to lie in, and build chimnees to warme thee in, and garners for thy corne, vvhy doeſt thou not ſeeke bowels to hide the ſecrets of thy bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els? And thou muſt know, that thou oughteſt nor to truſt the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:3666:128"/>ſecrets of thy heart, but vnto another who is thy heart. Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> vnto <hi>Ruffinus</hi> ſayth, Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou doſt enter into friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with any faithfull friend <hi>(Ruffinus)</hi> learne better how to keepe him than thou diddeſt keepe <hi>Ierome:</hi> for a good friend is not found euery where the is long a ſeeking for, and ſeldome gotten, he is hardly kept and eaſily loſt, he is recouered very ſlowly, and the want of him felt very quickly. <hi>Chilo</hi> the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher ſayth, I am halfe of my friend, and my friend is halfe of me, in ſo much that I muſt ſeeke him in me, and my ſelfe in him, becauſe he is I, and I am hee. And hee ſaith further, that when my friend dieth in him whom I loued, halfe of my ſelfe died with him, and halfe of him remaineth aliue with mee, in ſo much that by my will I ſhould die, if it were not to keepe that part of him which remained in me aliue. This vertue of friendſhip could not bee better praiſed, than this Philoſopher hath done it, ſeeing hee doth confeſſe, that halfe of himſelfe is in the graue with his friend, and that halfe of his friend was aliue in his ſoule, and that he deſired to liue for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, but becauſe his friend ſhould not die in him. To come then vnto our purpoſe, if all this be true, we ſhould haue great compaſsion vpon Chriſt, ſeeing his Father tooke his friends from him, ſeparated his kin from him, &amp; left him no comfort by his acquaintance. It is much to be noted, that Chriſt doth complaine that his Father took but one friend fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, &amp; one kinſman, but many of his acquaintance; to note vnto vs, that of faithfull friends there is ſcarſe one to be found, and of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous kinſmen hardly one, but of acquaintance a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. O that hee knoweth but meanly what friendſhip is, who putteth a friend, a kinſman, and his acquaintance vnder one reckoning, becauſe that I am to call him only my friend who loueth me, &amp; him my kinſma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> who is a good Chriſtian, &amp; all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my neighbours &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions my acquaintance. To ſpeak properly, Chriſt had but one friend only who was his Father, &amp; no other friend like vnto him; &amp; one only which was of his kindred, who was his mother, &amp; none other like vnto her: but
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:3666:128"/>he had great acquaintance among the Iews: &amp; in that great conflict which he had in his paſsion, his friend forſooke him, his kindred did not helpe him, and his acquaintaince ſhewed themſelues vngratefull. Thou diddeſt remoue farre from me, my friend, ſeeing that thou O my Father, wouldeſt not heare me when I praied vnto thee in the garden following the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the fleſh: and thou diddeſt remoue my kin from me, ſeeing that my mother could not help me on the Mount of Caluary; and thou diddeſt remoue my acquaintance from me, ſeeing that there I was put to death by them. O in what great danger, and in what a narrow ſtrait the ſon of God vvas at the time of his paſsion, ſeeing he complaineth that his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did not heare him, his mother did not helpe him, and none of his friends would know him. Thou diddeſt ſay very well O ſweet Ieſus, that <hi>Elongaſti a me amicum &amp; proximum,</hi> ſeeing thy friend who was thy father, could comfort thee but would not; thy kin who was thy mother, would but could not helpe thee; and thy acquaintance who was <hi>Iudas,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would nor could accompany thee, in ſo much that vpon the altar of the croſſe thou diddeſt abound in torment, and want friends. O that wee had a farre better friend of thee, than thou haddeſt of vs, ſeeing that <hi>Totum belli pondus verſum eſt in Saul;</hi> When as to make an attonement betwixt vs and thy Father, he did lay all the danger of the warre vpon thy ſhoulders. <hi>Non eſt qui vtrumque poſsit arguere, &amp; ponere ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num ſuam in ambobus,</hi> ſayth <hi>Iob</hi> chapter 9. As if hee would ſay, The one is ſo ſtrong, and the other ſo obſtinate, that there is no man able to ſatisfie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor who dareth put his hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that holy ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, that he ſaw two men at a variance, which al the world could not make friends &amp; ſet at agreement, &amp; yet did not name the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it is ſmall doubt but he vnderſtandeth ſome great ſecret &amp; hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> myſtery. Of theſe two which holy <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeaketh of, who is the ſtrong &amp; mightie one, but only our eternal God, &amp; who the obſtinate man, but he who is without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort? <hi>Cyrillus</hi> ſaith, That God &amp; man, &amp;
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:3666:129"/>man &amp; God did ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dle one another very hardly, becauſe man did nothing but ſin, &amp; God did neuer ceaſe to puniſh, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is, that in thoſe daies they called God, <hi>Deus vltionu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us vltionu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> twiſe; becauſe he did neither pardon their bodies of puniſhment, nor their ſoules of the fault. Becauſe God was the higheſt and chiefeſt goodneſſe that was, and man incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto wickedneſſe, God did command him to better and amend himſelfe: vnto which he anſwered that he would bee merry and take his pleaſure; by reaſon whereof man went e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day worſe and worſe, and God more angry and incenſed euery day againſt him. Pope <hi>Leo</hi> ſayth, That God doth not weigh whether we be weake or ſtrong, in health or ſicke, rich or poore, ſimple or wiſe, but that which he deſireth, is that we ſhould be good, and he is angry if we be naught: and therup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it is, that hee neuer caſteth any good man out of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, nor hee admitteth no naughty man into his houſe. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſayth, That hee could not ſuffer one ſinne in him who was an Angell, and doeſt thou thinke he will ſuffer ſo many ſinnes in thee who art but a man? And hee ſayth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that God would rather ſuffer, that an Angell ſhould take heauen from him, and man the world, than ſuffer one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinne either in the one or in the other; becauſe that to make a new heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is of ſufficient power, but to like and approue a ſinne, neither is his power able to doe it, neither can it bee comprehended vnder his clemency. Seeing then that God is ſuch an enemie vnto ſinne, and ſeeing that man doth ſo much couet to ſinne, how can they bee but contrary the one vnto the other, and vſe one another like enemies? Holy <hi>Iob</hi> doth weepe and ſigh, ſaying, <hi>Non eſt qui poſſit vtrumque arguere,</hi> that is, there was no man who durſt be a mediator betwixt them, nor put himſelfe betweene them, to the end that man might giue ouer ſinning, &amp; God withdraw his hand from puniſhing. <hi>Damaſcen</hi> ſayth, When God and man, and man and God, were at ſtrife and variance, and the one alwaies aboue in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and the other continually vpon the earth, there vvas no
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:3666:129"/>meane to make them meet, nor no court to agree them in, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there came none downe from heauen to vs, nor any fit perſon went hence from vs to heauen. The ſon of God came the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into the world, and put himſelf a mediator between them both, that is, betweene God and fleſh. O how much wee are bound to Chriſt for that which he did for vs, and much more for the manner with the which he did it! for the more to bind the one and the other, he tooke the diuinity of his Father with the which he might pardon vs, and tooke fleſh of man, with the which hee might ſuffer with vs. In ſo much that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he tooke his kindred and alliance of both, hee was able to make them both friends. O how coſtly this friendſhip and kindred was to the ſon of God, and grieuous alſo, ſeeing that it did coſt him his bloud which was in him, &amp; the life which hee poſſeſſed ſo farre forth, that for to make mee friends with God, he became an enemy vnto himſelfe. It is certaine that when two enemies doe draw their vveapons to fight, if ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther venter in betwixt them, that both their blowes do light vpon him, in ſo much that hee vvho parreth them is hurt or ſlaine, and thoſe which were at debate proue after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward good friends. On the Mount of Caluary, and on the altar of the croſſe, as God and man, and man and God, had ſummoned the one the other to a place of defiance, bleſſed Ieſus put himſelfe betwixt them both to cut off the ſtrife, becauſe hee knew that if hee had not taken away all anger at that place, they vvould haue remained perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all enemies. As man threw ſinnes at God, and God pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment vpon man, it fell out that the ſinne which man fought with, and the puniſhment with the which God did chaſtiſe, fell all vpon the Mediatour who had not deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it. O good Ieſus and glory of my ſoule, vpon whome but vpon thee did thy Father lay his old anger, vpon whome but vpon thee did man lay his fault? Doe not then vexe thy ſelfe O holy <hi>Iob,</hi> and ſaie, <hi>Non est qui ponat manum ſuam in ambobus,</hi> ſeeing hee is already come from heauen, and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:3666:130"/>already borne in the world vvho hath put his hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and man, yea and hath both his hands cut off by them? Haue not they both trow you cut off his hand, ſeeing his Father ordained that hee ſhould die, and man put the fault on him for which hee ſhould bee crucified? O diuine mediatour, O holy ſtickeler! which of the Angels could doe the like, or vvhat man could attempt that which thou haſt done? That is willingly, and vpon good and long deliberation, thou diddeſt offer thy ſelfe to loſe thy life, to ſet God and man in concord and vnitie. The ſonne of God then doth complaine vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Father with iuſt cauſe, ſaying, Why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken mee? ſeeing that hee did load all his wrath vpon his backe, and man likewiſe lay all the burden of his ſinnes vpon his ſhoulders, vpon him in that place God did emptie all his wrath, and in that place mans ſinnes tooke their end. O that this is a glorious time, and a happie age which vvee of the Catholicke church liue in! for hauing Chriſt for our Mediatour, there can no ſinne goe vp to the Father, but it muſt firſt meet with Chriſt, nor any puniſhment come downe vpon man, but it muſt alſo come by him. The ſonne of God being a meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his Father and vs, who doubteth but that hee will ſtop our ſinne in himſelfe, that it aſcend not to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and alſo keepe backe the puniſhment of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that it doe not deſcend into the world?

The ſonne of God ſpake theſe words, continuing his complaint againſt his Father: and it is as if hee would ſay, What meaneth this O my Father, what meaneth this? Waſt thou not content to breake thy anger vpon me, and remoue all my friends from me, but now anew thou wilt compaſſe mee with a great floud of water, in the which my life is drowned? Chriſt doth ſet foorth at large all his trauails, and bewaileth the want of friends: for hee ſayth that the waters were great, and he ſaith twiſe that they beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged him, and that they came all together vpon him, and that they came ſo ragingly, that they tooke away all his forces. Firſt of all, we muſt examine here of what kind of waters our Lord ſpeaketh in this place, whether they bee ſea waters, or of a riuer, or fountaine, or of a lake, becauſe that in all theſe a man may drowne himſelfe, and loſe his life. We read onely of two puniſhments which God hath inflicted by waters, the one in the floud of <hi>Noe,</hi> in which almoſt all the world peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, the other which he vſed againſt the people of Aegypt in the red ſea; the which two puniſhments were ſo famous, that our Lord hath not vſed the like vntill this day. The ſonne of God dooth not complaine of this kind of floud, nor wee doe not read that he euer was in danger by water: for being Lord of all the waters, how is it poſsible that he ſhould bee drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the waters? The ſonne of God complaineth of ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger flouds than theſe, of more raging ſeas, &amp; more ſalter wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:3666:131"/>of whoſe bitterneſſe none taſted ſo much of as hee did, nor no man went ſo neere the bottome of them as hee did. What waters were they then which compaſſed the ſonne of God, but onely moſt grieuous tribulations, which paſſed through his heart, and tormented his body?

O in what great anguiſh of mind hee was who ſpake theſe words! for to ſay that anguiſh went to his heart, was nothing elſe but to bee grieued at the heart. The waters of tribulation, and the floud of vexation entred into no mans heart ſo deepely, as into our Sauiours: for ſeeing that we were the cauſe of them all, as he did loue vs from the heart, ſo hee did feele them from the heart. It is to bee noted, that hee doth not ſay that the water did wet him, or bemite him, or make him afraid, for all theſe things doe not kill, but onely put vs in feare. All the perill of water is, that a ſuddaine ſtreame doe not carry vs away, and that our life doth conſiſt in nothing but in the ſuddaine grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or decreaſing of the water. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayth, That no man can be in greater danger in this life, than hee who ſeeth himſelfe compaſſed with waters, becauſe that at the ſelf ſame time our ſoule and life goeth out where the waters goe in, and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters goe out where our ſoules goe in. To what other thing could the ſon of God better compare his anguiſh &amp; diſtreſſe, than vnto one compaſſed about with waters? It is to bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that he ſayth, <hi>Circumdederunt me,</hi> Haue enuitoned mee, becauſe the water which raineth doth wet onely, the water throwne daſheth onely, and that which is dronke filleth, but that which compaſſeth on euery ſide drowneth: and therfore Chriſt ſaith they haue iucloſed me on euery ſide; &amp; ſaith not they haue wet me, becauſe his bleſſed heart was drowned in the ſea of ſorrow, and his ſacred body in the floud of torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts.
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:3666:131"/>The waters which compaſſed him about, &amp; the flouds which fell vpon him were ſo great, that my tongue is not able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe them, nor my heart to thinke them, nor my fingers to write them, nor my eies to bewaile them. O good Ieſus &amp; my ſoules delight, how or when diddeſt thou ſee thy ſelfe enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned with waters, but when thou ſaweſt one member pulled fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another on the Mount of Caluary? O that it is an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſpeech to ſay that thou waſt compaſſed with water, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that thou mighteſt with greater reaſon haue ſaid, that thou diddeſt ſee thy ſelfe drowned in bloud, becauſe that in that lamentable day of thy death thou diddeſt want water, and flow in bloud. It is nor without a deepe myſtery and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſecret, that Chriſt ſaith, that hee was compaſſed about with water, although it were true that he was enuironed with bloud: and the reaſon is, becauſe there is no man who is ſo greatly recreated by drinking a cup of cold water, nor taketh ſo great contentment in it, as good Ieſus did in ſhedding his bloud to redeeme the world with it. Chriſt ſayth then, they haue compaſſed me about like vnto water, becauſe that if he did looke vpward, hee ſaw his Father who would not ſeeme to heare him, if downward he ſaw but his mother, who could doe nothing but weepe for him, if hee did looke on the left hand he ſaw but a thiefe, who would not beleeue in him, if on the other hand hee ſaw another thiefe who could not helpe him. He was compaſſed on euery ſide: for if hee ſhould haue looked behind, he ſhould haue ſeene the hangmen watching him, and before him the Iewes a mocking him. Chriſt ſaith, they haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſed me like vnto a water: vpon which words S. <hi>Barnard</hi> ſayth thus, O good Ieſus, O my ſoules delight, what pitty did moue thee, what charity did force thee, being nailed vpon the croſſe, loaden with thornes, beſet about with ſpeares, yet thou ſaieſt that thou art compaſſed with waters? Doeſt thou die vpon the croſſe, and that with great thirſt, &amp; couldeſt not get a cup of water to drinke, and yet doeſt thou ſay, that thou art co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſed with water? What loue hath tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported thee, or what goodneſſe hath made thee paſt thy
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:3666:132"/>ſence, that thou ſhouldeſt thinke the bloud which iſſueth from thee, ſhould bee water that runneth out of thee? What meaneth this O redeemer of my ſoule, what meaneth this? Doth thy hard nailes, cruell ſpeares, grieuous thornes, ſeeme to be fountains of ſweet waters? The loue which Chriſt bare vs in ſuffering was ſo infinite, that all things ſeemed ſweet and pleaſant vnto him, becauſe it is a priuiledge of loue that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſeemeth hard and painful vnto him which loueth, but that which he doth vnwillingly. The ſonne of God doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vnwillingly in this world, vnleſſe it bee when hee puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth our offences: for although he do many things daily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing praied thereunto, yet hee doth nothing being forced. Chriſt doth complaine alſo that they compaſſed him with many flouds of waters comming together: for hee ſayth, <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumde derunt me ſimul,</hi> which kind of perſecution is no leſſe painfull than perillous, nor perillous than painefull. <hi>Plato</hi> to this purpoſe ſayth, That when griefes and vexations come by little and by little, they ſeeme to bee ſomewhat tollerable: but when they come by heapes, they are vntollerable; and the reaſon is, becauſe man had no time to foreſee ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, nor place to auoid them. <hi>Baſil</hi> vpon the Pſalme ſayth, That griefes and vexations came vpon that moſt bleſſed hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of Chriſt, like a very great water, and like many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies which laid in ambuſh, the which Chriſt would not nor did not reſiſt, nor yet flie away from, but only beſeech his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to giue him more ſtrength to endure and abide them. <hi>Bede</hi> ſayth in an Homily, O that this thy loue which thou diddeſt ſhew in this ſpeech of <hi>Quare me dereliquisti</hi> was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable, and thy charity incomparable! for if thou doeſt complaine to thy Father, it was not becauſe he ſhould take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſome part of the torment which thou diddeſt ſuffer, but becauſe hee would not giue thee longer life to ſuffer more. <hi>Vbertinus</hi> ſayth that Chriſt ſaid very truly, when he ſaid, that whole flouds of many waters had compaſſed him round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, becauſe that in the compaſſe of foure &amp; twentie houres he was watched, apprehended, denied, accuſed, whipped, and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:3666:132"/>receiued ſentence, ſpoiled, crucified, and dead; inſomuch that if we compare the moments of times with his torments, wee ſhall ſee, that the torments which hee ſuffered vvere more than the moments and quantities of the time in which he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> vpon the Pſalme ſayth, That no man could euer ſay theſe words of <hi>Circumdederunt me aquae tota die &amp; ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mul,</hi> with ſo good reaſon as Chriſt; becauſe on that day which he ſuffered in, there paſſed no houre, nor moment, nor minute of time, in the which he was not either ſtrocke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or whipped, or ſpit vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or blaſphemed: inſomuch that thoſe miniſters of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes were ſo buſie &amp; haſty in giuing him torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that they themſelues had no time to reſt them in, nor Chriſt to breath in. Pope <hi>Leo</hi> vpon the Paſsion of our Sauiour ſayth, That hee had great cauſe to ſay, that hee was compaſſed with many waters, becauſe that all kind of people and all nations conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in one againſt that moſt ſacred humanity, Iews, Gentiles, Prieſts, Phariſies, Diſciples, Pontifes, Kings, Captains, Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours, hangmen, yong, old, ſtranger, and all others. S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayth this: What people were therein the world which were not at the death of Chriſt, or what torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t was there inuented which he ſuffered not? In ſo tempeſtious a ſea, in ſo dangerous a floud, in ſuch ſudden waues, and in ſuch diſtreſſes heaped one vpon another, who would not haue the ſonne ſay vnto the Father, Why haſt thou forſaken mee, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hee did not ſpeake one word to comfort him, nor left him any one friend which did fauour him?</p>

Theſe words were ſpoken by all the Angels, vnto the Lord of all Angels, who was the ſonne of God, and it is as if he would ſay: O ſonne of God, O eternal wiſedome, being deſcended fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> into this world aliue &amp; whole, how doeſt thou come now from thence with ſuch a pittifull body, and ſo wounded in thy hands? If thou wilt know where, how, and by whome I haue receiued theſe wounds and gaſhes, know thou that I haue receiued them in the houſe of ſuch as loued me, and they gaue them me who bare me good will. Looke how new and ſtrange this queſtion is, ſo maruellous is the anſwere; and how maruellous the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, ſo ſtrange the queſtion: for it is a very ſtrange thing that God ſhould goe to heauen with wounds vpon him; and to ſay that his friends gaue them him, is alſo a very maruellous thing, becauſe it is the part of a friend to cure our wounds, and of an enemy to make them. What is this O good Ieſus, what is this? How can hee vvho loueth thee vvound thee, and hee who wiſheth thee well hurt thee, and hee who woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth thee take pitie on thee, and hee vvho ſerueth thee offend thee? <hi>Anſelmus</hi> handling this place ſayth, O eternall goodneſſe of thee my God, and patience neuer before this time ſeene, ſeeing thou doeſt call them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly thy friends which rent thy fleſh, vvreſt thy ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes, vnioint thy bones! To ſay O good Ieſus that thou vvaſt vvounded in the houſe of ſuch as loued thee, is a ſpeech vvhich ſheweth thy clemency, and giueth
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:3666:133"/>me great confidence: for if thou doe call thoſe thy friends which doe wound thee and kill thee, what wilt thou doe by them which faithfully haue ſerued thee? Chriſt had one houſe in Iury, which was Ieruſalem, and hee had a friend in heauen which was his Father, and he had another friend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth which was the Synagogue, and in that houſe he was put to death, and hee was wounded by thoſe two friends: for the Synagogue did crucifie him, and his Father did deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that he ſhould be crucified. If the Gentiles which were not his friends &amp; acquaintance ſhould haue put him to death, it would haue been tollerable: but to ſee that he was wounded &amp; ſlain in the city where he had liued, &amp; by his friends which he had made much of, &amp; by the wil of his Father which begat him, did grieue him very much, although he did diſſemble it. <hi>Barnard</hi> ſaith, The more I think vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy works O good Ieſus, the more I wonder; ſeeing that man hauing done the deeds of an enemy towards thee, thou canſt not call him enemy but friend, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering that thou ſaiſt, I haue been wounded in the houſe of ſuch as did loue me. By which words hee doth let vs vnderſtand, that he regardeth more the loue which hee bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth vnto the world, than the offences which the world doth vnto him. If as good Ieſus ſaid vnto the Angels, my friends haue thus wounded me, hee would haue ſaid vnto his Father that his enemies had done it, what ſhould then haue become of the poore Iewes, and what afterward of vs all? As when friends in ieſting doe hurt and ſcratch one another, ſo Chriſt would make the Angels and his Father beleeue, that his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies had not wounded his ſacred hands, but that his friends had done it as it were in ſporting. O how truly we may ſay with the Prophet <hi>Dauid, Non eſt deus noſter ſicut dijeorum,</hi> Our God is not like vnto their gods, ſeeing that here vpon earth men take in earneſt the words which their friends ſpeak in ieſt to them, and if they ſcratched with a pin, or with ones naile, they make no leſſe a matter of it, than if it were a thruſt with a lance. The which quality could not ſincke into Chriſt, ſeeing that before his father, he called his enemies his friends,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:3666:134"/>his whipping ſcratching, his deep wound a raiſing of the skin, and earneſt teſting. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> vpon theſe words, <hi>Amice ad quid veniſti,</hi> ſayth, this word Enemy, O good Ieſus, wil not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into thy mind, becauſe thou art accuſtomed to call euery man friend: for ſeeing that thou diddeſt call <hi>Iudas</hi> thy grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt enemy thy friend, whome wilt thou call enemy? <hi>Oſculan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes ſe ad inuicem fleuerunt pariter Dauid &amp; Ionathas; ſed Dauid fleuit amplius.</hi> 1. Reg. chap. 20. Theſe holy words are rehearſed in ſcripture, talking of the friendſhip that was betwixt <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> and <hi>Ionathas:</hi> and this is their meaning; As king <hi>Dauid</hi> was departing out of the kingdome, and going from <hi>Ionathas</hi> his faithfull friend, at the time of their departure they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced one the other, and wept; and although <hi>Ionathas</hi> did weepe much, yet <hi>Dauid</hi> did weepe more. <hi>Mimus</hi> the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher ſayth, That the loue which one friend beareth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is neuer better knowne than when the one departeth from the other; for if the one want words, the other aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in teares. <hi>Cicero</hi> in his booke of Friendſhip ſayth, That true friendſhip is knowne in going the one from the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in their embracing the one the other, they change their hearts, in ſo much that this mans heart goeth away with him, and his heart remaineth with this man. It ſeemeth that <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Ionathas</hi> vvere great friends, ſeeing that they did embrace one another ſo heartily, and wept ſo tenderly. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> did much more eſteem of the friendſhip of <hi>Ionathas,</hi> than of the hatred of his father king <hi>Saul:</hi> the which was eaſily ſeene to bee ſo, conſidering that when <hi>Saul</hi> made a truce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, <hi>Dauid</hi> preſently departed out of the kingdome. <hi>Dauid</hi> vvith all his wiſedome and force durſt neuer abide the perſecution of <hi>Saul</hi> his enemie, vvithout his friend <hi>Ionathas</hi> aid: vvhereby vvee may inferre, that there is no griefe in this life equall to the loſſe of a friend. Bee hee (ſaith <hi>Seneca</hi>) poore or be hee rich, be hee great or be hee little, how is it poſsible for him to liue without a friend? <hi>Horace</hi> ſayth, That if a man be in proſperous eſtate, he hath need of one to giue him coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, if in meane to comfort him: for I haue heard (ſayth he)
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:3666:134"/>my maiſter <hi>Menander</hi> ſay, that a fortunate man hath as great need of good counſell to gouerne himſelfe by, as the needy man hath need of helpe to lift vp himſelfe by. If then the mighty haue need of good counſell, and the poore of helpe and ſuccour, who can better giue vs good counſell, or ſupplie our vvants than a friend? <hi>Eſchines</hi> in an inuectiue againſt <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes</hi> ſayth, That an enemy can doe his enemy no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vvrong, than take his good friend from him, becauſe hee taketh away the ſecret of his heart, the refuge of his trauails, the remedy of his neceſsities, and reliefe and cheriſhing of his perſecutions. <hi>Plutarch</hi> maketh mention, that when <hi>Denis</hi> the Tyrant did ſcoffe at <hi>Phocion</hi> the Philoſopher, for that he vvas poore, hee made anſwere thus, I confeſſe vnto thee that I am poore, but yet <hi>Denis</hi> is poorer: for although hee abound in money yet hee vvanteth friends, and I haue friends inough but vvant money. That Philoſopher thought it a greater po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty to want friends, than to want money: wherein hee had great reaſon, becauſe that in tribulation or ſickneſſe, it doth eaſe a man better to ſee two or three friends at his beds head, than to haue his cheſts &amp; coffers full of gold and ſiluer. There are many (ſayth <hi>Vbertinus</hi>) vvhich are poor of money, &amp; not of friends, and others which are poore in friends and not in money, and there are ſome which are poore in the one and in the other, of which ſort Chriſt is the chiefe, ſeeing that on the croſſe, he had no man which vvould beſtow a cup of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vpon him, nor any one which would giue him one word of comfort. Chriſt complaineth of the Apoſtles becauſe they fled, complaineth of his parents becauſe they did hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, complained on his acquaintance becauſe they did not ſticke vnto him, becauſe that in all the conflict of his paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hee had no friend which followed him, no kinſman which defended him, nor acquaintance which backed him. Chriſt had (ſayth <hi>Rabanus</hi>) very honourable and vertuous friends, and valerous acquaintance; but vvhen they ſaw him weake in ſtrength, and poore in wealth, all of them left him in his troubles, becauſe they vvould not bee the partakers
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:3666:135"/>of his daunger. Saint <hi>Barnard</hi> crieth out and ſayth, What meaneth this O good Ieſus, vvhat meaneth this? There vvanteth not one in Ieruſalem to defend <hi>Barrabas,</hi> and dooth there vvant one before <hi>Pilate</hi> to defend thee? Doth <hi>Barrabas</hi> by ſtealing find friends, and doeſt thou by preaching get enemies? Doth the murderer of the quicke find defenders, and doth the raiſer of the death find accuſers? Doe they condemne him who made an attonement betwixt God and man, and doe they ſet him at liberty who diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all Ieruſalem? O vnhappy and wicked Ieruſalem, will there be alwaies ſome in thee to perſecute the good, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the wicked? Venerable <hi>Bede</hi> ſayth, That al thoſe which were <hi>Barrabas</hi> friends, were Chriſts enemies, and all thoſe which were Chriſts friends, were <hi>Barrabas</hi> enemies: for with the ſame note and voice that they cried, doe not let goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but <hi>Barrabas,</hi> they ſaid of Chriſt, crucifie him. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in an Homily ſaith, That becauſe the twife doubling of a word is the true token of loue or hatred, the Iewes did well ſhew the loue which they bare vnto <hi>Barrabas,</hi> in deſiring <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute</hi> twiſe to let him looſe, and the hatred which they bare to Chriſt in ſaying twiſe, Crucifie, crucifie him. For to ſay twife <hi>Non dimittas nobis niſi <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And to crie out twiſe aloud, crucifie, crucifie him, what elſe would they ſay to <hi>Pilate,</hi> but that they aske with their tongues, &amp; entreat with their hearts that hee would put Ieſus of Nazareth vpon the gibbet, or put him to death vpon the croſſe? <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> ſaith, The Prince of the Synagogue, and the ruler of Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum, <hi>Centurio</hi> the captaine, <hi>Zacheus</hi> the rich, and <hi>Simeon</hi> the leaper, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> the knight, were not all theſe, trow you, Chriſts friends and acquaintance, and of the richeſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourableſt among the people?

The daughter of that famous captaine <hi>Iepthe</hi> ſpake theſe words vnto her father when her father returned from the war which the people of Iſrael had againſt the king of the Ammonites: as though ſhe wold ſay, Do with me O my Father, doe with me what pleaſeth thee. For ſeeing that thou doeſt come victorious from the warre, it is very iuſt and reaſonable that thou ſhouldeſt performe that which thou haſt promiſed our Lord. <hi>Iepthe</hi> had promiſed and made a ſolemne vow, that if God would giue him the victory of that warre, that he would offer vnto him the firſt liue thing of his houſe which he ſhould meet withall; and although it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue vvhen hee ſhould meet it, yet he vvould not offer it but killed and dead. <hi>Iepthe</hi> then returning from the vvarre vvith a great victory, his ſorrowfull fate vvas, that hauing but one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly daughter, ſhe vvent to meet him &amp; receiue him comming home ſinging and playing on a Taber.

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:3666:136"/>in that I muſt open my mouth, and make that promiſe to ſuch great preiudice to thy life, and hurt vnto my houſe? His daughter anſwered him and ſaid, If thou haſt opened thy mouth, my father, to make any vow vnto the great God of Iſrael, let mee bee no hinderance for the performance of it: for I vvill like it well, onely becauſe I ſee thee victorious o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer thy enemies. And ſhe added further and ſaid, only I aske of thee my father, that thou wouldeſt giue mee two months ſpace before thou doeſt ſacrifice mee in the Temple, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile my Virginity in theſe ſorrowful mountains with others my companions. And when thoſe two months were paſt, (the tender virgine bewailing and weeping the loſſe of her life and virginity vnbeſtowed) the Father performed his vow, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed his daughter. Becauſe <hi>Iephthe</hi> that captaine had that famous victory, but yet with vufortunate loſſe of his onely daughter, all the young maids and virgines of the people of Iſraell agreed a meeting to weepe and lament the death of <hi>Iephthes</hi> daughter foure daies in the yeare; and although the people of the Iewes did omit thinges of greater weight than that was, yet they did neuer forget to mourn and lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thoſe daies. The holy ſcripture doth promiſe vs many great matters in this figure of <hi>Iephthe,</hi> worthy to be knowne, &amp; hard to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound.

The ſcripture maketh mention, that when <hi>Iephthe</hi> was a yong man, thoſe of his countrey put him from his fathers inheritance, &amp; baniſhed him out of the land, and how that in progreſſe of time hee deliuered them from their enemies, and vvas captaine ouer them all.

For as they which did baniſh <hi>Iephthe</hi> out of all the kingdome, did afterward entreat him to bee their guide and captaine: ſo thoſe which ſaid to <hi>Pilate,</hi> crucifie, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie him, did afterward on the Mount of Caluary ſtrike their breaſts and ſay aloud, <hi>Verè hic filius deifuit,</hi> This man was truly the ſon of God. Who was vnderſtood in <hi>Iepthes</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a virgine faire and young, but only that fleſh and huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Word? S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> vpon thoſe words <hi>Specioſus ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> ſayth, Who is ſo beautifull, who is ſo pure, who ſo holy, as that moſt ſacred fleſh vvas and is? The daughter of <hi>Iephthe</hi> was not knowne of any man, and Chriſts humanitie was alſo vnknowne of man, ſeeing that it was not conceiued by conſent of husband, but formed and framed by the vvebe of the holy ghoſt. <hi>Iephthe</hi> did promiſe to offer in the Temple his only daughter for the victory which hee had obtained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his enemies, and Chriſt did promiſe to offer vpon the croſſe his owne fleſh for the victory and conqueſt vvhich he had againſt ſinnes; ſo that <hi>Iephthe</hi> did offer only the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vvhich hee had begotten, and the ſonne of God did offer his owne proper body. Is it not thinke you a greater mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for a man to offer his owne fleſh, than that vvhich is born of his fleſh? <hi>Iephthe</hi> vvas very loath and grieued to offer his onely daughter, and it vvas a great corraſiue to the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters heart, to ſee her ſelfe ſacrificed by her owne Father: but in the end ſhee vvas more ioyfull and glad of the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vvhich her Father receaued againſt his enemies, than grieued that her owne life ſhould bee ſacrificed. O how vvell one myſtery doth anſwere vnto another! for vvhen the fleſh ſaid, Let this cup paſſe from mee, vvith the daughter of <hi>Iephthe</hi> hee vvas loath to die: but vvhen hee ſaid, Not as I vvill, but as thou vvilt, hee was glad to ſuffer: ſo that that ſacred fleſh vvas very vvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to bee ſacrificed, becauſe that the diuine Word ſhould obtaine victory ouer ſinnes. Doeſt thou not
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:3666:137"/>thinke my brother, that one myſtery doth very vvell anſwere another, and that one ſecret is very vvell compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vvith another, ſeeing that that virgine vvas ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for her fathers honour, and that diuine and ſacred fleſh alſo ſacrificed for the honour and glory of his father? <hi>Iepthe</hi> had a great reuenge ouer his enemies, but Chriſt a farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ouer ſinne: and yet it is to be noted, that by how much the greater thoſe two victories vvere, ſo much the more greater vvere the prices vvhich they vvere bought for, becauſe the one did coſt his daughters life, and the other his owne. What can be deerer than that vvhich doth coſt a mans life? <hi>Pellem pro pelle &amp; cuncta dabit home pro animaſua,</hi> ſaith <hi>Iob</hi> chapter 2. The Scripture maketh mention in <hi>Iob,</hi> that as there appeared before the iudgement of God many vvicked men, the deuill made one among them: for good men doe neuer aſſemble themſelues to doe good, but Sathan is there alſo to doe them ſome hurt. Our Lord ſaid vnto Sathan, from vvhence doeſt thou come, and vvhither haſt thou gone? To this Sathan an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, I haue gone about all the earth, and vvalked through it, to ſee whether I could happen vpon any more that vvere mine. Our Lord replied, haſt thou ſeene my good ſeruant and truſty friend <hi>Iob,</hi> vnto vvhome no man on the earth may bee compared? And doeſt thou not know Sathan that <hi>Iob</hi> is a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, ſincere in condition, vpright in his conſcience, fearfull in that vvhich the law commandeth, vvithout malice, &amp; one vvho continueth till this day in his innocency? Thou haſt ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me vp againſt him, that I ſhould kil his ſonnes, deſtroy his ſheepe and deere, and that his oxen ſhould be ſtolne fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, and all his vvealth taken from him, and that I ſhould depriue him of all his honour. Sathan anſwered vnto this and ſaid, Know Lord, that a man vvill giue all his vvealth &amp; ſubſtance vvith condition to ſaue his life. <hi>Pellem pro pelle dabit hemo,</hi> that is, A man vvill giue al his ſheepe skins, &amp; all the cowes hides in the vvorld to keepe his owne fleſh. If thou vvilt trie Lord vvho thy friend <hi>Iob</hi> is, lay thy hand vpon his owne perſon, and fill his bodie with a leproſie, and then thou ſhalt ſee, that hee
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:3666:137"/>will bee more grieued to ſee his body plagued, than to ſee his goods taken from him. This then was the reaſoning and dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue which paſſed betwixt God &amp; the diuell touching <hi>Iobs</hi> tentation: whereof we may inferre, how much more that is to be eſteemed which the ſonne of God offered, than <hi>Iephthes</hi> ſacrifice, becauſe the one offered his daughter, and the other his owne proper life. The victory which <hi>Iephthe</hi> had, was a coſtly victory vnto him, but Chriſts was more coſtly, becauſe that <hi>Iephthe</hi> did ouercome and liue, but the ſonne of God did ouercome and die, and there is no dearer victory in the world than that which is bought with the exchange of a mans pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per life. Although <hi>Iephthe</hi> did loue his onely daughter well, yet Chriſt did loue his precious fleſh better, becauſe it was vnited vnto the diuine eſlence, and therefore the better hee did loue it, the more was his griefe in loſing it. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayth, That wiſe men doe loue their liues better than others of the vulgar people, becauſe they ſee themſelues more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary vnto the Commonwealth, and euery common good is to be preferred before a particular. And according vnto this ſaying of the Philoſopher, as the ſonne of God was wiſer than all men, and better than all men, ſo without doubt by ſo much the more he loued his life, by how much it was moſt profitable to all men. Sathan ſaid well <hi>Pellem pro pelle dabit ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> A man will giue one skin for another. For if a man would haue asked the captaine <hi>Iephthe</hi> which of theſe two thinges he would rather haue done, either haue ſacrificed his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or his owne perſon, it is to bee thought that hee would rather haue ſacrificed his daughter twiſe, than his owne perſon once. <hi>Seneca</hi> in his booke of Clemency ſayth, That becauſe it is a naturall thing vnto vs to liue, and a dreadfull and fearefull thing to die, wee are much afraid of our owne death, and beare another mans eaſily. <hi>Theophilus</hi> ſaith, That it is much to be maruelled that Chriſt would die; but it is much more to bee wondered at, that hee would die with ſo good a will, becauſe that without augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his glory, yea rather diminiſhing it, hee offered himſelfe
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:3666:138"/>willingly vnto them, to the end that they ſhould take his life from him. The figure ſayth further, that <hi>Iephthes</hi> daughter, went two months weeping and wailing her virginity on thoſe ſolitary mountains, with other virgines and maids which bare her company. What was the meaning that that pare virgine, bemoned and bewailed her virginity, but onely that ſhee was ſorry that ſhee had not been married, and had a husband, and that ſhe had no children to mourne for her death, or inherite her goods? It ſeemeth to bee a diſhoneſt matter for a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to weepe, and bewaile her owne virginity, if there were no other hidden ſence vnder this letter, becauſe that in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the more obſcure a ſaying is, the more fuller it is of my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery. Wee haue already ſaid that Chriſts ſacred fleſh is figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by that tender virgine, and now wee ſay againe, that as <hi>Iephthes</hi> daughter bewailed her owne virginity, ſo did Chriſt likewiſe his: only it is to be noted, that there is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt weeping and weeping, virginitie and virginity. The ſonne then doth complaine on his father ſaying, Why haſt thou forſaken me: which he vttered becauſe hee had not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied his moſt pure virginity and moſt holy innocency as he deſired to doe: for as he was borne a virgine, a virgine hee died; and if hee came innocent into the world, with his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency hee returned vnto heauen againe. Let no man thinke that Chriſt bewailed and wept his virginity, becauſe hee did inuiolably keepe his moſt holy fleſh: for if his mother did not loſe it in bringing him into the world, neither could hee loſe it by liuing in the world. The chaſtity which the ſcripture ſpeaketh of, and the virginity which Chriſt bewaileth with <hi>Iephthes</hi> daughter, is not the corruptible virginity, but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, not the virginity of the body, but of the ſoule, the which doth make our Lord great with holy ſpeeches and diuine inſpirations; and therefore if hee bee great with theſe diuine inſpirations, he bringeth forth afterward holy workes. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> vpon thoſe wordes, <hi>Deſponſauit te mihi in fide</hi> ſayth, Spirituall and holy men haue as great need to marry their foules with Chriſt, as worldlings haue to ſeeke husbands
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:3666:138"/>for their daughters: and if I haue ſaid as great, now I ſay more need; becauſe a maid may bee ſaued without the company of a husband, but a ſoule cannot be ſaued vnleſſe ſhe take Chriſt with her. S. <hi>Barnard</hi> ſayth, O how farre more higher is the ſpirituall matrimony, than the corporall! the one is betweene the wife and her husband, the other betwixt the ſoule and Chriſt; of the one come children, which ſometimes do breed griefe &amp; anger, of the other there do proceed workes which doe alwaies good. If <hi>Iephthes</hi> daughter doe weepe her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting out of this world a virgine, euen ſo doth Chriſt weepe and lament his virginitie, becauſe hee hath left no greater a ſpirituall poſteritie after him: for he would willingly haue left all the hearts in the world great with child with good &amp; ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous deſires, and all ſoules deliuered of good workes. When God ſaid by the Prophet <hi>Eſayas, Numquid ego qui alijs gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationem tribue, ſterilis ere?</hi> That is, Shall I be barren my ſelfe and giue iſſue vnto others? hee did not ſpeake this for any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire which hee had to marry himſelfe with any woman, but for the great zeale which hee had to marry and couple him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with our ſoules; becauſe that in all ages and all times the chaſtity of the body is a holy thing, and in all ages &amp; all times the barrenneſſe of the ſoule is naught and diſcommendable. What doeſt thou weepe for then O good Ieſus, what doeſt thou weepe? I weepe my virginity with the daughter of <hi>Iephthe,</hi> becauſe I haue ſcarſe found any in all the world who will marry with my diuine grace, nor who will be great with child with my diuine inſpirations: and that which I miſlike moſt of all is, that if I begin to dally and make loue with any ſinfull ſoule, ſhe turneth her backe towards mee, and is ready to flie from mee. I bewaile my virginitie, becauſe that in three and thirty yeares which I haue liued in the world, with al the ſermons which I haue preached, and with all the dead which I haue raiſed vnto life, and with all the diuels which I haue caſt out, and all the ſinnes which I haue forgiuen, it ſeemeth vnto mee that I haue made ſmall gaine, and done lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle good in reſpect of the paines which I haue taken.
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:3666:139"/>I bewaile my virginity, becauſe that being come in perſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, hauing inſtructed all the people, ſhed my bloud, rent and torne my fleſh, loſt my reputation, and beſtowed my life, yet I ſee now that there is ſcarſe any one found who would benefit himſelfe with my bloud, or who is thankful vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me for my benefites beſtowed vpon him. I bewaile my vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity, becauſe I haue found none to beſtow my virginity on, none to giue my innocency vnto, none to impart my patience vnto, none vnto whome I may communicate my charity, nor any one with whom I may leaue my humility in keeping: but if I came rich and adorned with vertues in the world, ſo I muſt return rich again with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to heauen. The figure which wee haue ſpoken of, ſaith further, that all the maids of Sion did meet in Ieruſalem to mourn and weep the death of <hi>Ieph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes</hi> daughter foure daies one after another, in the which they made great lamentations, ſo that no yeare did paſſe, in which this ſolemnity was not obſerued. It is here to be noted, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there haue beene in the ſynagogue many perſonages, noble in bloud, valerous in warre, diſcreet in the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, learned in all ſciences, and cleane and vnſpotted in life, yet it is not read of any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that after they were dead and buried, were mourned for at any other time. Al the kings, Dukes, Patriarks, and Prophets were buried by their friends and kinſfolkes, and forgotten of them, excepted onely the daughter of <hi>Iephthe,</hi> for whoſe death all the virgines and maids did mourne and weepe euery yeare once by a ſpeciall priuiledge. Wee ſpeake all this becauſe that if the daughters of Sion thought it conuenient to thinke vpon and weepe for the death of that virgine once euery yeare, ſhould it not bee greater reaſon that wee ſhould weepe for the death of Ieſus Chriſt euery houre and euery moment of an houre? Thoſe virgines did weepe for the death of that young virgine for no other reaſon but becauſe ſhe was young, beautifull and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſo that they were induced to make that ſolemne lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation rather through compaſsion than reaſon. What other reaſon could there bee for that ſolemne yearely lamentation,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:3666:139"/>ſeeing that the daughter of <hi>Iephthe</hi> died not for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, nor yet had in eſtimation for any rare vertue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the reſt? Iuſt occaſion and reaſon doth inuite vs to weep euery houre, and euery moment of an houre, for the death of Chriſt, conſidering that he died for the Commonwealth, and paied for our offence. For the ſon to ſay vnto his father, Why haſt thou forſaken me, is to ſay nothing elſe, but to complaine of vs becauſe wee remember not his precious death, as <hi>Ieph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes</hi> daughter was wept for once a yeare. Although the ſinfull ſoule doth not remember the death of Chriſt, yet the holy church doth not forget nor omit to celebrate his death once at the end of euery year in the holy weeke. And in ſteed that the daughters of Sion did weepe for the death of that virgin foure times in the yeare, the church doth repreſent vnto vs the paſsion written four times of the foure Euangeliſts.</p>

O that the Apoſtle ſaid very true, when hee ſaid, all things happen

For if it were not ſo, there are many things in Scripture which vvould ſeeme but a ieſt to write of, and a ſuperfluous thing to read.

This figure doth lead vs vnto higher my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries than the letter doth ſhew, and therefore it is needfull to haue a high ſpirit to declare it, and great attention in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it. To come then vnto the purpoſe, <hi>Iſaac</hi> in the Hebrue tongue doth ſignifie a man ful of laughter and ioy: the which ioifull name can agree only vnto the ſonne of God, and hee only in this world in a high degree can be called <hi>Iſaac.</hi> When rhe ſonne of God was in heauen aboue, and before hee came downe into this world, no mortall man knew any cauſe to laugh, nor yet durſt not laugh: for becauſe that they ſaw that God was angrywith all the world, al the world was in a dump and mourned. When God had ſaid vnto <hi>Noe</hi> the Patriarke, <hi>Paenitet me feciſſe hominem,</hi> that is, I am ſorry and repent that euer I made man, how could any man dare to laugh and bee merry? How durſt holy <hi>Iob</hi> laugh, ſeeing that hee ſaid with many teares, <hi>Vtinam de vtero tranſlatus eſſem ad tumulum:</hi> I would to God I had been buried as ſoone as euer I was borne. His meaning was this, O great God of Iſrael, why haſt thou brought mee out of my mothers wombe, and now that thou haſt brought me out, why doeſt thou not deſtroy me, &amp; why did deſt thou not carry mee preſently from my mothers bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els to my graue?

But when the fulneſſe of time came, in the which God ſent his ſonne into the world, hee brought mirth with him, he brought pleaſure with him, hee brought the ioies of heauen with him, where they doe nothing elſe but laugh and reioice, as we doe nothing elſe but mourne and weepe. Did not trow you our ioyfull <hi>Iſaac</hi> come laughing into the world, ſeeing that when hee was borne, the Angels did ſing, <hi>Gloria in excelſis Deo,</hi> Glory bee to God on high? <hi>Damaſcen</hi> ſayth, That if the words which God ſpake, and the works which he did be weighed with grauity, they doe all giue vs ioy &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and put vs in a great confidence of our ſaluation, and take away the diſtruſt of damnation, becauſe hee ſpake and did much more in the fauour of clemency than hee did in the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of iuſtice.

By <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaacs</hi> ſheepe the good people of Iſrael were vnderſtood, which came vnto the knowledge of Chriſt: ſuch were <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, Nicodemus, Ioſeph, Zacheus,</hi> the good thiefe, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, all which were of the number of the elect. By <hi>Iſaacs</hi> oxen and kine which are of the greater ſort of beaſts, all the Gentiles, from whome all wee which are Chriſtians doe deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend: for euen as a cow is greater than a ſheepe, euen ſo the holy mother the church is greater tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Synagogue. Theſe are the kine which the ſonne of God came to ſeeke, theſe are the ſheep which our <hi>Iſaac</hi> came to keepe: for of the other flocke and heard which old <hi>Iſaac</hi> had, our redeemer of the world neuer had calſe nor lambe. The figure ſayth alſo that <hi>Iſaac</hi> had a great family, and many bondwomen which ſerued him at table, &amp; many men which gathered in his wealth. Our <hi>Iſaac</hi> was a poore man in this kind of bondmen, and women, as hee was of beards and flockes of cattell and ſheepe: for his pouerty was ſo great, that no man would liue with him, nor dwell in his houſe.

Who would not be glad O good Ieſus, who would not bee glad to loue thee, ſerue thee, and follow thee, ſeeing that thou art ſo courteous in thy words, and ſo gratefull in thy deeds? Who would not be glad to dwell in thy houſe, and who would not be willingly one of thy family, ſeeing that thou doeſt call ſtrangers thy acquaintance, thy enemies thy friends, thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants thy companions, and vngratefull men thy brothers?

In his laſt ſupper, and in his laſt Sermon, when he ſaid, <hi>Pater,</hi> Father keepe them which beleeue in mee, and ſuch as will beleeue in me, hee did well ſhew the loue which he bare vnto his family, ſeeing hee praied vnto his Father for thoſe which were already borne, and for thoſe which ſhould be born afterwards, for theſe which were abſent, and for thoſe which were preſent, &amp; as well for the dead, as for thoſe which were aliue. O happy is that ſoule, vvhich doth dwell in the family of the ſonne of God, ſeeing that hee loueth him before that hee is borne, and vvhen hee is borne giueth him iuſtice, and after his death glory.

To come then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our purpoſe, vvhat mortall man hath there euer been, is, or ſhall bee, who hath been ſo much enuied as the ſonne of the liuing God was? What was the cauſe of ſuch vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable enuie in the Iſraelites, but his excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in knowledge, his skilfulneſſe in learning, his
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:3666:143"/>vprightneſſe in iuſtice, and the purity of his life? The Iewes raged, and were ready to hurt themſelues to ſee Chriſt vtter ſuch great myſteries of Scripture as hee did, preach ſo many ſermons vnto the people, doe ſuch ſtrange miracles in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, preach publickly againſt vice, and draw vnto his companie thoſe which were alwaies accounted honeſt. The Iews malice againſt Chriſt was greater than the Paleſtines againſt <hi>Iſaac,</hi> becauſe they did nothing but command <hi>Iſaac</hi> to go out of the land; but the Iewes did not commaund Ieſus, but they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with their owne hands drew him out, and not ſatisfied with that, they agreed afterward to crucifie him. They did ſhut vp the water where <hi>Iſaac</hi> did drinke, but they did open Ieſus hands and ſide: and therefore comparing hurt with hurt, and loſſe vvith loſſe, it was a greater loſſe to take Chriſts life from him, than to take <hi>Iſaacs</hi> vvater from him. Is it not thinke you a greater hurt to open a mans vaines of bloud vvith the vvhich hee liueth, than to ſhut vp a mans wels vvhereof hee drinketh? If men ſhut vp my wels I open others, if I haue no vvater I drinke vvine, if they expell me out of this country, I goe vnto another; but if they draw my bloud from me, vvho vvill giue me more bloud, and if they breake my vains vvho vvill lend me others, and if they take my life from mee, vvho vvill helpe me vnto another? Chriſt then vvas vvorſer hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led through enuy than <hi>Iſaac:</hi> for if <hi>Iſaac</hi> did liue in honour, he vvent away vvith honour, and if he came aliue into the land he vvent away aliue: but vvhat ſhall we ſay of holy and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Ieſus, vvhoſe family they did ſcatter abroad through en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy, vvhoſe mother they ſeperated away from him, vvhoſe bloud they ſhed, vvhoſe doctrine they contaminated, and vvhoſe fame they obſcured, and al through enuy and malice? <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> ſayth, As all the riches of man doth conſiſt in his ſoule, his credite, his life and goods, ſo the Phariſaicall enuy and malice did leaue Chriſt none of all theſe: for they tooke his ſoule from him, they diſcredited him in his fame, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued him of his life, and left him no goods at all. How farre thinkeſt thou did all his goods reach, but onely vnto a torne

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:3666:144"/>them preſently, who ſent forthwith to apprehend them; and they perceiuing that they were diſcouered, ran away with all ſpeed, and came very weary to Bahurim, where they entered into a houſe, and knowing that they were purſued, went into a well, and the good wife couered the well with a ſheet, and when <hi>Abſalons</hi> people were come, and inquired after them, ſhee made anſwere that they came thither very weary, and drinking a cup of water, they ran away with all ſpeed, and ſo <hi>Abſalons</hi> ſouldiours not hauing any hope to ouertake them, are gone back again to Ieruſalem. And when they were gone away, <hi>Achimaas</hi> and <hi>Ionathas</hi> came out of the well, and went vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> and did aduertiſe him of the aduiſe which <hi>Chuſi</hi> did ſend him. The wiſedome of this Inne-keeper was great conſidering that through her only wit <hi>Achimaas</hi> and <hi>Ionathas</hi> eſcaped ſafe, and <hi>Abſalons</hi> ſcouts were deceiued. <hi>Mimus</hi> the Philoſopher ſayth, That a friends aduiſed and deliberated counſell is beſt, and an enemies firſt counſell to be feared, and a womans ſodden wit to be followed: for if ſhee haue time to thinke vpon that which ſhe ſhould ſay, ſhe wil direct her vow &amp; voice vnto that which her hart is moſt inclined vnto. It is conuenient here to declare what the well is, what the ſheet with the which it was couered, who they were which did hide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in it, &amp; who they were who did ſeek out thoſe which were hidden in the well, &amp; who the woman was which ſaued thoſe which were hidden, and who they were which were mocked by her. To come vnto the firſt point, what ſhall wee ſay the well to bee, but the old and new Teſtament: the which well was high becauſe it ſpeaketh of high matters, and alſo deepe, becauſe it ſpeaketh of profound matters; it is a well becauſe no man can draw it drie and emptie it, and it is of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter becauſe it treateth of nothing but of moſt cleane and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things. Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> vpon thoſe vvords, <hi>Puteus altus est,</hi> ſayth thus, Although the vvels bee neuer ſo deepe vvith vvaters, yet the holy Scripture is farre more profoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de in deepe and hidden myſteries, becauſe the vvater may be emptied with a rope, but the myſteries of Scripture cannot

When <hi>Dauid</hi> the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaid vnto God. <hi>Da mihi intellectum &amp; ſcrutaber mandata tua,</hi> Who doubteth, that ſeeing he craued for grace to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſcriptures, but that they cannot be vnderſtood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grace? Chriſt ſpake many things vnto his Apoſtles vvith his owne mouth, which they did not vnderſtand for vvant of grace: and if this bee ſo, how dare any man preſume to ſay, that he doth vnderſtand the Scripture without grace, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les he know himſelf lightned with grace? there be many men which die for thirſt, becauſe they wil not go for water, &amp; theſe are Pagans which haue no faith: and there bee others which goe for vvater and take not a cord with them, and theſe are Heretikes vvhich doe not vnderſtand the Scripture well: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers there be vvhich doe take a rope vvith the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but doe take no veſſell to put in, and theſe are ſimple men which can read the Bible, but cannot vnderſtand it. He who will draw vvater out of this holy vvell, ought to take the cord of ſcience and knowledge vvith him, and a pitcher of conſcience, becauſe he ſhal neuer or very late vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the Scripture, who doth not ſtudy it vvith a holy purpoſe and meaning. What other meaning hath it that the vvell vvas couered and ſtopped vp, but that the old Teſtament vvas very darke and obſcure?

What other thing did the breaking and rending of the vaile of the Temple at Chriſts death ſignifie, but only that hee did open and reucale vnto vs the myſteries of the old Teſtament? What dooth it mean that the vaile of the Temple was rent in two at Chriſts death, &amp; that the vaile which <hi>Moſes</hi> had ouer his face was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer rent &amp; broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that the holy catholicke church is only lightened, &amp; that the Synagogue lieth hidden vntill this day with her <hi>Moſes?</hi> According vnto that ſaying of the Apoſtle, <hi>Adhuc velame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſt ſuper facie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Moiſi,</hi> that is, vntill this preſent day <hi>Moſes</hi> face is couered, to wit, the Iews are hardened with him.
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:3666:145"/>Much good may it doe vnto the Synagogue to keepe their <hi>Moyſes</hi> vvith his face couered, but the holy mother the church hath her Chriſt bare and open vpon the croſſe: for as in dying he did ſhew vs all his holy fleſh, ſo he did diſcouer &amp; open all his ſecrets vnto vs in preaching.

What is the meaning that the ſelfeſame wel vvas an occaſion that ſome ſhould eſcape, &amp; others be moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, but that one and the ſelfe ſame ſcripture is cauſe that the catholickes doe ſaue themſelues, and the Heretikes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne themſelues? What doth it meane that <hi>Abſalons</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants did neuer meet vvith the vvell, but that the poor Iews haue not as yet met vvith Chriſt? It is much to be weighed, that <hi>Abſalons</hi> ſcouts and ſpies did looke no further than the ſheet vvhich couered the vvell, and in like manner the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Iewes doe looke no further than the exterior let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the old Teſtament doth ſay; vnder vvhich <hi>Ionathas</hi> and <hi>Achimaas</hi> doe lie hidden, that is to ſay, the humanity of the vvord, and the vvord it ſelfe. Remoue and take away, O you Iewes, take away the ſheet of your ignorance, take away the ſheet of your malice, take away the couering of the letter, and vvithdraw the vaile of your obſtinacy: for vntill you doe forſake your errour you ſhall neuer meet vvith Chriſt ſhut vp in the vvel.

The learned man doth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen ſo many wels of water, as he doth waies expound the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcripture; and the more obſcure the ſcripture is, the more deeper vve will ſay he fetcheth his water.

                     </gap>us,</hi> That of all the infelicities of this world, the greateſt is to haue his body ouerlaid with la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and his heart loaden with care. Reaſon is wont to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the anxiety of the mind, and good cheriſhing the labour of the body, but what comfort can the body giue vnto the mind, or the mind vnto the body, when the one ſweateth, and the other ſigheth? According vnto the litterall ſence, good king <hi>Dauid</hi> did complaine of both theſe trauails, that is, the trauell of the body, when hee ſayth, <hi>Et ego in flagella paratus ſum,</hi> and the trauell of the mind, when he ſaith, <hi>Et dolor meus in conſpectu meo ſemper,</hi> the which vexations hee ſuffered at the hands of king <hi>Saul,</hi> when hee wandered like a baniſhed man, and hid himſelfe in mountaines and rockes. <hi>Dauid</hi> endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red great labour of the body, as well for the iournies which he tooke, as for the hunger which he ſuffered: hee had great griefe of mind to ſee himſelfe a ſtranger in his owne land, a ſugitiue from his houſe, baniſhed out of the kingdome, and in diſgrace with his king. Although this be all true, yet who can better ſay, <hi>Et in flag ella paratus ſum,</hi> I am ready to be whipped, than Chriſts tender body, or who can ſay with him, <hi>Et dolor meus in conſpecta meo ſemper,</hi> and my griefe is alwaies before my eies, as his afflicted mind was? We cannot deny, but that <hi>Dauid</hi> was perſecuted, yet we doe not read that he was whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, the which we may affirme of Chriſt our redeemer, who was not only whipped at <hi>Pilates</hi> pillar, but was alſo ſhowne vnto the people with <hi>Bcce home,</hi> Behold the man. If <hi>Dauid</hi> cannot ſay of himſelfe, <hi>Ego in flagella paratus ſum,</hi> neither can hee ſay, <hi>Et dolor meus in conſpectu meo ſemper:</hi> But only the ſon of God can ſo ſay, becauſe there was no houre nor moment of the day in which his body was not trauelled, and his heart grieued. It is long agoe ſince I commended vnto my memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:3666:147"/>that ſaying of <hi>Plato, Quòd in humanis plura ſunt quaeterrent quam nocent,</hi> as if he would ſay, In dangers which happen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to man, and in humane chances, there bee many more things which put vs in feare, than that happen vnto vs in deed: for ſo many times the hart is martyred, as he thinketh vpon dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to come. When any malefactor hath receaued ſentence of death, from the time that the ſentence is read vntill his head be cut off he doth ſwallow death ſo many times as hee thinketh that he muſt die; in ſo much that if the ſword doth kill him but once in the end, yet his imagination doth kill him a thouſand times before. Then to apply this vnto our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, what Prophet was there at any time in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment who knew ſo much as Chriſt did? When the ſonne of God did prophecy that there ſhould not remaine one ſtone vpon another in Ieruſalem, did hee not as well know that there ſhould not bee left in his body one drop of bloud with another? When good Ieſus did prophecy vnto S. <hi>Peter</hi> that he ſhould die in his old age vpon the tree, did he not know as well that himſelfe ſhould bee crucified vpon the croſſe? If then the ſonne of God did know that he ſhould die, and that his death ſhould be, to be crucified vpon the croſſe, what ioy or mirth could there be in him? The ſonne of God had two things alwaies before his eies, that is, the croſſe and the nailes with the which they would crucifie him, and his enemies which would crucifie him, whoſe conuerſation hee neither vvould nor could eſchue, ſeeing that he came to redeem the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with his bloud, and conuert them with his doctrine. What man is ſo ſtout, or who is of that courage, that can liue &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe with him that muſt take his life fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him? O great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and infinit charity! good Ieſus, who but thou alone hath defended them who perſecuted him, protected thoſe who haue accuſed him, giuen honour vnto thoſe who haue diffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him, and pardoned their offences who haue taken his life from him? What wilt thou do, good Ieſus, what vvilt thou doe for thoſe which follow thee, and ſerue thee, if thou deale thus with thoſe which lay wait to intrap thy perſon, impugne
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:3666:147"/>thy doctrine, take away thy ſame, &amp; depriue thee of thy life? <hi>Anſelmus</hi> ſayth, That the ſonne of God did liue among ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, not becauſe he did like the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but becauſe he would amend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe no man euer tooke greater delight in reuenging than he in pardoning. To ſpeake more particularly, it was not without a high myſtery that Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Et ego in flagella para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ſum,</hi> hauing a greater regard vnto the laſlies which he was to endure, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto the death which they were to giue him; becauſe that a noble &amp; modeſt man doth grieue much more at one laſh with a whip giuen him in open place, than if they ſhould ſtrike off his head inpriſon.

One friend may ſuffer baniſhment for another, and bee taken for another; yet notwithſtanding no man doth ſuffer himſelfe to be turned naked &amp; whipped for any other, becauſe a friend

Although the complaint which Chriſt formeth in this place, doe containe but few words, yet it is full of many graue ſentences: for he complaineth not of many griefes but of one, hee ſayth not that it is another mans griefe but his owne, hee ſayth not that it is in an others mans ſight but in his owne, and
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:3666:149"/>hee hath it not by fits, but cootinually. If the Prophets doe not riſe againe to tell vs, and if the Angels doe not declare it vnto vs, how can wee be able to gueſte what griefe it is which laſted ſo long, and the complaint which hath no end. If the ſonne of God had been diſeaſed of a dropſie, or gout, or pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, we could haue ſaid that as his infirmity was, ſuch had ben his griefe: but ſeeing that wee doe not read that hee was euer ſick who can gueſle what his griefe ſhould be?

When Chriſt ſaith that my griefe is alwaies in my ſight, it is a thing to make vs both wonder &amp; feare: for ſeeing that Chriſts griefes were ſo many in number, and ſo cruell in torment, what ſhould he meane to complaine vpon one, ſeeing that they were without number and count?

What griefe can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared vnto this grief, ſeeing it hath his beginning in this world and doth not end in the other?

S. <hi>Barnard</hi> ſpeaking of our dury to God ſayth, If thou wilt know what God hath made thee, looke vvhat he hath done for thee: for in thy miſerable nature the vvorkes of his infinite benignity doe appeare. How much the baſer thy God made himſelfe in humility, ſo much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he made thee in goodneſſe, and how much the more viler
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:3666:149"/>hee made himſelfe for mee, ſo much the more familiar and like hee made me vnto him. Take heed then man, that thou be not prowd, ſeeing that thou art made of dirt, and ſee that thou bee not vnthankfull and vngratefull vnto God, ſeeing that thou art ſo neer coupled vnto him, becauſe an vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man was neuer pleaſant nor acceptable vnto God. It is the part of a peruerſe mind, to ſeeke occaſions and ſhifts to excuſe himſelfe, &amp; not to be gratefull for the benefites which he hath receiued: the which kind of treaſon and naughtineſſe is proper only vnto ſhameleſſe men, and to ſuch as haue dead hearts, and as it were without a ſoule. Who is he who cannot be thankfull for a benefite receiued, but he who neuer knew to doe good vnto others? All this is S. <hi>Barnards</hi> ſpeech. <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiodorus</hi> ſayth in an Epiſtle, That it is a hard matter to ſuffer, and not eaſie to diſſemble, that a wiſe &amp; diſcreet man ſhould gather no fruit of his trauaile, but that hee ſhould rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue hurt from whence hee hoped for remedy, in ſo much that he ſuffereth hurt without an offence giuen, puniſhment without a fault, griefe without cauſe, paine without ſin, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution without an enemy. Naughty mens manners would bee much worſe than they are, if there were none to chaſtiſe vice and reward vertue. <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſayth, That which Imaruell at in men is, that if they bee ſicke they commend themſelues preſently vnto God, if they haue warres they run to God, if they want water they aske it of God, if they bee moleſted with a plague, they turne to God, if they goe by ſea, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themſelues vnto God; but that which cannot bee ſpoken without griefe is, that after God hath deliuered them out of thoſe dangers, no man thinketh more of God. Do not thinke it (ſayth <hi>Seneca</hi>) to bee a ſmall misfortune vnto thee, if by chance thou haſt lighted vpon an vngratefull friend, becauſe that as a benefite or good turne is woont to make of a foe a friend, ſo the ſame benefite is wont to make an enemy of him who was thy friend. For it is the property of an vngratefull man, that the more that he is bounden vnto any man for any benefite receiued of him, the more he hateth him of whom
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:3666:150"/>he hath receiued it: and the worſt of all is, that they would ſee him dead of whom they receiued it, and not be thankfull at all for it. Thou doeſt complaine, O my friend <hi>Lucilius,</hi> that thou haſt fallen vpon more than an vngratefull man, and that of an old friend hee is become thy new enemy, and if thou wouldeſt enter into the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration of this loſſe, thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt abſtaine from euer doing any good turn vnto any: which I doe not counſell thee to doe, nor yet that thou counſell any man to doe it, becauſe it is better that men accuſe the other of vngratefulneſſe, than thy ſelfe of couetouſneſſe, and that the benefite bee loſt in the other, rather than rot in thee. There is no vice more common among men, than for one man to be vngratefull vnto another, which doth proceed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, hereof, that men know not how to make choice of their friends, or for that they doe not beſtow their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites well: and therefore oftentimes we haue greater reaſon to complaine vpon our ſelues, for not knowing how to giue, rather than of others, becauſe they bee vngratefull for the good turnes which they haue receiued of vs. <hi>Cicero</hi> in his third booke of laws ſayth, <hi>Clariſsimi viri Athenis pulſi carere ingrata ciuitate maluerunt, quàm manere in improba,</hi> as if hee would ſay, Many famous men in watres, and learned in ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, haue been baniſhed from Athens, not for any fault which they committed, but for malice conceiued againſt them; the which were rather willing and glad to liue in baniſhment than to dwell in an vngratefull citie. <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> ſayth, That the moſt notableſt man that the renowmed Lacedemonia did euer bring forth, was that great Philoſopher <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> becauſe among all thoſe which liued before his time, &amp; thoſe which ſucceeded him, there was none equall vnto him in knowledge, nor none which went beyond him in life. The O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle of <hi>Pithius Apollo,</hi> being asked in what reputation he did hold <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> made anſwere, I am very doubtfull vvhether I ſhould put him among the number of men, or place him among the companie of Gods. Notwithſtanding that the Oracle had giuen this high teſtimony of <hi>Lycurgus,</hi> and that
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:3666:150"/>he was pure in his life, eloquent in learning, conſtant in paines, and very wiſe in his lawes, yet all theſe vertues and excellent gifts could not keepe him from proouing the vngratefulneſſe of his thankleſſe citizens. And therefore they did not onely iniury him in words, but alſo they did ſhew by cruell deeds the hatred which they bare him, and the hurt which they wiſhed him: for once they burned his houſes, and another time they followed him with ſtones, and another time they daſhed out one of his eies, another time they expelled him from among the people, and in the end for a recompence and reward of gouerning that Commonwealth eight and thirtie years, they baniſhed him out of the country, and ſo hee died. <hi>Plautus</hi> ſayth, That there is no loue worſe beſtowed than that which is beſtowed vpon an vngrateful man, becauſe that man loueth nothing at all who loueth an vngratefull man. I haue ſpoken all this againſt the vice of vngratitude, and vſed ſo many examples, becauſe euery man might perceiue what great reaſon God hath to complaine vpon vngratefull men: for ſeeing that the Philoſophers doe inueigh ſo bitterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, it would be but ſmall reaſon that they ſhould be defended by Chriſtians. S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſayth, Chriſt doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of our ingratitude, becauſe that for ſo great &amp; vnſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a benefite as he did for vs in dying vpon the croſſe, hee did not bind vs to follow him in that kind of death, or that we ſhould die for him by the ſword, but that which good Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus did bind vs vnto is, that we ſhould haue his bleſſed paſsion in a remembrance, and loue him with all our heart. How ſhall any man (ſayth <hi>Barnard</hi>) beleeue that thou wilt venter thy life for Chriſt, and for his faith, ſeeing thou doeſt not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his death in all thy life? If thou wilt (ſayth <hi>Vbertinus</hi>) haue the death of Chriſt help thee in thy laſt houre, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that death of his euery day; becauſe the ſonne of God doth alwaies take pittie vpon thoſe in their laſt houre, vvhich doe remember his paſsion in their life time. Chriſt ſaith, And my griefe is alwaies before my eies, becauſe that among all the griefes which are, ingratitude is cauſe of
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:3666:151"/>the greateſt of them, and among all the ſinnes and naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe which are, this is the greateſt: for if there were no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull men vnto God, there ſhould bee no ſinne at all in the world. Chriſt doth cal the ſinne of vngratefulneſſe dolour and griefe, becauſe that hee is alwaies grieued with it: for the griefe which hee had of the thornes is paſt, his whipping had an end, and the paine of the croſſe dured no longer than his life did laſt, but the griefe of ingratitude is renued in him dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Chriſt doth alſo ſay, that the griefe which hee doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of is his owne griefe, <hi>Dolor meus:</hi> by which louing ſpeech he doth let vs vnderſtand, that he is much more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to ſee vs ſinne, than it grieueth vs to be ſinners. Why doth Chriſt ſay in his complaint, my griefe, and not our griefe but onely becauſe that wee doe not feele ſo great paine and griefe when we are puniſhed by him, as good Ieſus feeleth to thinke that he muſt puniſh vs. I would to God that it would pleaſe his diuine clemency, that I were ſo ſory to commit an offence, as it doth grieue him to puniſh me: for then I thinke that I ſhould not know how to ſinne, nor God ſhould haue nothing to puniſh. He complaineth alſo that he doth not only ſuffer griefe, but he ſayth that that grief is alwaies in his ſight; and therefore becauſe wee doe neuer giue ouer ſinning, it is certaine, that his griefe of compaſsion wil neuer haue an end. Ceaſe then my brother, and giue ouer ſinning, and then the paine which thou doeſt endure, will preſently haue an end. When thou ſhalt heare vs ſay that God hath any griefe or paine, thou muſt not thinke that it is a griefe or paine which hee ſuffereth, but onely a moſt entire and louing compaſsion which he hath vpon vs. When the ſonne of God ſayth vpon the croſſe vnto his Father, Why haſt thou forſaken mee, the chiefeſt complaint that hee formeth in that place is, becauſe hee cauſeth him to ſuffer ſo cruell a paſsion for ſuch vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full people.</p>

Vnder theſe few words God doth touch very many great matters: for firſt he beginneth to call them, then he bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them giue eare, then he ſaith that it is hee who calleth them, then he noteth who they bee whom hee calleth, then how vvell he loueth them, when hee ſayth, <hi>Qui portamini ab vtero adſenectutem,</hi> But we muſt note firſt of all in this place, why the Lord doth ſeperate the houſe of <hi>Iacob</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the houſe of Iſrael, and why hee doth call the houſe of <hi>Iacob</hi> an entire houſe, and the houſe of Iſrael a broken and diſſolued houſe: for he ſayth, heare mee all you of the houſe of <hi>Iacob,</hi> all you of the houſe of Iſrael which haue eſcaped, and remaine. If <hi>Iacob</hi> and Iſraell, and Iſrael and <hi>Iacob</hi> bee all one thing, and all one houſe, fauing that one man had two names, how vvas it poſsible for the one to ſtand, &amp; the other to fal? In very truth in old time all the Synagogue had but one God, one people, one linage, one king, one law; but when they began to ſinne and play the Idolaters, our Lord did immediately deuide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. By the one houſe &amp; by the other are vnderſtood the church
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:3666:152"/>and the Synagogue, whereof the one, which was <hi>Iacobs,</hi> came wholly vnto the church, and Iſraels fell vnto the Synagogue, but almoſt ouerthrowne, not becauſe ſhe deſerued it not, but becauſe all which was written might bee fulfilled. According vnto this Prophecy, the Angell ſaid vnto the virgine in his embaſie, He ſhall raigne in the houſe of <hi>Iacob,</hi> &amp; he ſaid not, he ſhall raigne in the houſe of Iſrael, becauſe the Synagogue did then draw towards an end, and the church vnto her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning in the ſonne of God. God then calleth the houſe of <hi>Iacob,</hi> which is the church, calleth thoſe which remained of the houſe of Iſrael, which is the Synagogue, becauſe Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was the reſidue of Iſrael, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due of Iſrael, and all thoſe of his Colledge were the remnant of Iſrael, the which the ſonne of God vvent throughout all the Iewiſh nation to gather together as it had been crummes of bread hurled abroad. Now that wee know what the houſe of <hi>Iacob</hi> is, and thoſe who remained of the houſe of Iſrael, it is now reaſon alſo that wee know what hee will doe vvith them, and why he doth call them, and why he vſed a ſpeech vnto them, which was neuer hard of before, that is, that hee doth beare them vpon his ſhoulders from their mothers wombes. God will haue nothing elſe with them, but onely that they beleue in him and heare him, ſeeing he ſayth, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite me</hi> Heare me: and withall hee doth put them in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the great benefites that hee doth for them, to wit, carry them vpon his ſhoulders, <hi>Portamini ab vtere;</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we will haue Gods fauour, we muſt beleeue the words which he doth ſpeake, and bee thankfull vnto him for all the benefites that hee ſhall beſtow vpon vs. <hi>Robertus</hi> vpon <hi>Eſay</hi> ſayth, If wee will compare that which God requireth at our hands with that that hee doth giue vs, vvithout compariſon hee doth bind himſelfe vnto more than that which hee doth bind vs vnto: for hee doth bind vs to nothing, but to beleeue in him, and hee doth bind himſelfe to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and gouerne vs, <hi>Ab vtero vſque ad ſenectam:</hi> that is, from the time that wee bee firſt borne, vntill our dying
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:3666:152"/>day our Lord doth bind himſelfe to bring vs vp like his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and maintaine vs like his brothers, in ſo much that like a pittifull Father, and a mercifull Lord, hee giueth vs that which we haue need of, and counſelleth vs that which we haue to doe. O infinite goodneſſe, and exceeding charity of thine, my good God, conſidering that by this ſpeech, <hi>Ab vtero portamini,</hi> thou doeſt bind thy ſelfe to giue vs food to liue vvith, and by <hi>Audite me,</hi> thou doeſt bind thy ſelfe to giue vs counſell to ſaue our ſelues vvith! and therefore vvee haue of thee a Lord to helpe vs, and a Father to counſell vs. Our Lord, vvhich did create vs, is a better Father vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs than man vvhich doth beget vs, ſeeing that hee ſayth, <hi>Qui portamini ab vtere:</hi> By vvhich fatherly ſpeech hee doth let vs vnderſtand, that hee doth not only prouide for our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsities, but doth alſo diſſemble our iniquities. O that our Lord doth ſay very vvell, <hi>Qui portamini ab vtero,</hi> ſeeing that hee doth beare vs on his ſhoulders as oft as hee doth vvinke at our wickedneſſe: for if hee ſhould puniſh vs for euery fault according vnto his iuſtice, wee ſhould by this time haue had no memory left of vs. If our Lord ſhould not beare vs vpon his ſhoulders, and diſſemble vvith our faults, to prouoke vs to repentance, hee ſhould ſcarſe haue any at all to puniſh aboue two or three houres; and for the firſt ſinne only, if it had pleaſed him, he might haue condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vs to hell. What temporall father doth ſo long ſuffer his owne children, as our Lord doth all vs. What father doth carry his child in his armes aboue an houre, as our Lord doth vs all our life time? Before wee bee borne, wee offend him in originall ſinne, &amp; after we be borne we offend him al the reſt of our life with other grieuous ſinnes; yet notwithſtanding all this, hee doth bring vs vp like his children, and deale vvith vs like brothers.

There is no liuing creature this day in the world, that doth giue milke vnto his young ones aboue two yeares: but our eternall Father and Chriſt his precious ſonne, from our birth vntill our old age, doth giue vs the milke of his grace, the bread of his doctrine, the helpe and ſuccour of his church, the pardon of his clemency, and the reward of his glory. <hi>Dilexit me &amp; tradidit ſemetipſum pro me,</hi> ſayth S. <hi>Paul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

This is ſo ſtrange a thing, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of in this place, that vnleſſe a man bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the phraſe of Scripture, hee would take ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale at it: for when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that Chriſt died for him, not mentioning any other, he ſeemeth to exclude the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the world beſide. What meaneth this, O diuine <hi>Paul,</hi> what meaneth this? if the ſonne of God did giue himſelf for thee, why doeſt thou preach him to bee the redeemer of all mankind? Were thy ſinnes ſo grieuous and ſo enormious that they had need of all Chriſts bloud to redeeme them? If God ſhould ſend into the world a new redeemer for the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of euery ſinne, how were it poſsible that God could ſend ſo many, ſeeing that hee had no more ſonnes but Chriſt? Tell me I pray thee, how could ſo glorious a huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, ſo profitable a life, ſuch ſound doctrine, ſuch a copious redemption, ſuch a dreadfull death bee emploied in thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and not benefite any but thy ſelfe? If it bee ſo O <hi>Paule</hi> that Chriſt gaue himſelfe for thee, and not for me, what haue I more to doe with Chriſt than with a holy Prophet? If hee died for thee alone, is it not reaſonable that thou alone ſhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt be thankfull for his death? God forbid that it ſhould be ſo, neither doth his mercy permit that the Apoſtle onely ſhould be redeemed, and all the world beſides depriued of the bloud of Chriſt: for his redemption was ſo copious, and
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:3666:153"/>there was ſuch abundance of bloud ſhed for vs, that on Chriſts part redemption did abound, and there wanted on ours to be redeemed. Did not redemption, think you, abound on his part, ſeeing that one drop of his bloud was ſufficient for all redemption; and did there not want on our ſide, ſeeing that if there had ben an hundred thouſand worlds, he would haue redeemed euery one of them? When the good Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaid, <hi>Tradidit ſemetipſum pro me,</hi> hee ſpake it not to exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate and diminiſh Chriſts paſsion, nor ſtraiten his redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but to confeſſe before all the world, that whatſoeuer the ſonne of God had ſuffered vpon the croſſe, hee was as much and as ſtreitly bound to bee gratefull for it, as if hee had died for him alone. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his booke of Chriſtian doctrine ſayth. As our Lord did know euery mans offences in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, ſo hee did redeem euerie of them particularly, in ſo much that euery man in particular is as greatly bound vnto him for his bloud; and as certaine a debtour vnto him for his death, as if hee ſhould haue redeemed him alone, and ſuffered for him only and no other. <hi>Theophil</hi> ſayth, Euen as in thy creation thou art as greatly bound vnto God as if he ſhould haue cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated thee and no other, ſo in thy redemption thou art <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

S. <hi>Barnard</hi> ſaith.

Doe not thinke that Chriſt bought vs ingreat, and at the firſt ſight, as flockes of ſheepe are bought, but hee bought euery man by himſelfe alone, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:3666:154"/>in particular for euery ſinne, ſo that as he found many in the world, ſo hee redeemed them all: but if hee had found but one ſinfull ſoule in the world, hee would haue beſtowed his precious bloud in redeeming her alone. <hi>Iſidorus Deſumme bono</hi> ſaith, Mark and note wel, good Chriſtian, that Chriſt did not leſſe loue thee, than he loued me, neither did he buy thee with leſſer trauel tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he bought me, not giuing leſſe bloud for one than for all. And thereupon being as it were carried away with great loue towards vs, he eſteemed not, nor did not look to the price which he gaue for vs, but vnto the loue with the which he bought vs. If our bleſſed Lord would haue looked vnto the ſmalneſſe and baſe value of that which he did buy, as hee did looke vpon the great loue with the which hee did buy vs, would hee, thinke you, haue beſtowed one drop of his bloud vpon vs? If humane nature ſhould be ioined and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled with the nature of Angels, and that of them both there were made one nature, what could it doe, what were in it, what were it worth, that the ſonne of God ſhould ſhed ſo much as one drop of bloud for it? That it vvould pleaſe Chriſt to die for vs, let vs thanke the great loue which he bare vnto vs, and not any deſert or merit of our owne. For if he ſhould haue expected at our hands that we ſhould firſt haue deſerued it, he ſhould yet be to take fleſh vpon him, &amp; to redeeme vs. <hi>Origen</hi> in his Periarchon ſayth, As the ſunne whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he riſeth, doth no leſſe giue light vnto al tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto one, &amp; aſwell vnto one as vnto all: eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo the ſon of God did not die more for all tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for one, nor noleſſe for one tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for all. <hi>Barnard</hi> ſaith, O infinite goodneſſe, O inſpeakable charity! which of all creatures wold haue done ſo much for thee as thou haſt done for me, that is, eſteem more of my ſoule, than of thy own life, of my honor tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thy fame, of my rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thy paſsion, &amp; of my remedy &amp; help than of thine own hurt.

If euery man will examine his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, he ſhall find it to bee true, that he knoweth all theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes and euils, not by any ſcience which hee hath heard, but by experience within himſelfe, ſeeing that we ſee nothing elſe euery houre, but euery man to weepe and bewaile his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite paines and griefes? And becauſe we may not ſeeme that we doe ſpeake at pleaſure, we will ſpeake of euery word a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, to bring thee to remembrance, how euery one of theſe griefes is experimented in thy ſelfe. As concerning the firſt, which is death, what mortall man was euer borne in this life, whom death in the end hath not made an end of, and put into his graue? With this condition we come into the world, and liue in the world, that in the end wee muſt leaue the world, and that by reaſon of a common law which he hath giuen vs. The ſecond griefe are teares: and what mortall man did euer liue in this world with ſuch great ioy, but hath wept at ſome time or other, and that heartily? <hi>Horace</hi> ſayth, That weeping is ſo naturall a thing vnto all mortall men, that we be borne weeping, liue weeping, and die weeping. <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> ſayth.

The third paine is ſorrow: for what mortall man did euer attaine vnto ſuch ſure and quiet ſtate of life, that hee ſhould neuer need to fetch at any time a deepe ſigh? O that it is well ſeene in the life of holy <hi>Iacob,</hi> that to mourne, ſigh, and weepe, are offices and duties ſo annexed vnto the miſerable life of man, that we ſhall firſt ſee our ſelues dead, than free from them! The griefes which trouble our mindes are ſo many, and the anxieties which charge our bowels are ſo huge and ſtrong, that lamenting and vvailing is taken for a remedy, and ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a comfort, and weeping for an eaſe; becauſe it happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth often to afflicted minds, that the more teares they ſhed, the more eaſe their hearts receiue. The fourth paine, which is griefe: what man hath euer beene ſo ſtrong and healthy, who hath not beene throwne downe with ſome ſickneſſe, or beaten vvith ſome great affliction? O that the Apoſtle ſaid very well, that vvee haue a treaſure in fickle veſſels, ſeeing that vvee are ſo weake in ſtrength, and feeble of health, that wee doe nothing but keepe our ſelues from the ſunne leaſt hee burne vs, and from cold leaſt it goe through vs, and from the aire leaſt it diſtemper vs, from the vvater leaſt it ſtop vs, and from meat leaſt vvee diſgeſt it not. <hi>Auerroes</hi> ſayth, That becauſe theſe inferiour bodies are ſubiect vnto the ſuperiour influences of the heauens, they paſſe great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, and are endangered by the ſtarres and planets: for the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements often changing in themſelues the bodies which are made of them, doe alſo the like. Of all the riches of this life, there is none equall or to bee compared vnto health, becauſe that all other paines and griefes either time doth cure, or diſcretion doth moderate. The fiſt paine, vvhich is feare: vvhat mortall man had his heart euer ſo at reſt, that no feare hath euer come vpon him, or in vvhome no ſuddaine paſsion hath raigned? <hi>Menander</hi> ſayth, That of neceſsitie there muſt raigne in mens hearts, mirth or ſorrow, loue or
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:3666:156"/>hatred, paine or eaſe, and hope or feare; but of all theſe, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and hatred, paine and feare, are thoſe which doe moſt of all raigne in our bowels, becauſe we ſee mirth and loue, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and hope, either late or neuer come to our dore. <hi>Cicero</hi> in his Commonwealth ſayth; put caſe that wee loue many things, yet without compariſon wee feare more thinges, and that which is worſt of all is, that our loue doth change euery day, but our feare doth neuer depart from vs. <hi>Plautus</hi> ſayth, How merry ſo euer our countenance bee, and how full ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of laughter thy mouth bee, and howſoeuer the tongue talketh, yet neuertheleſſe the ſorrowfull heart is loaded with feare; for hee feareth leaſt his credite and honour ſhall bee taken from him, or leaſt they ſteale away his vvealth, or leaſt his life be neere an end, or leaſt that vvhich hee loueth ſhould be long abſent. <hi>Xenophon</hi> ſaith, What pleaſure or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment can raigne in any mortall mans heart, ſeeing that wee ſuffer ſo many griefes without vs, and ſo many feares tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vs within vs. Loe then you ſee theſe fiue principal griefs prooued vnto you, although it was not needfull to prooue them, ſeeing wee ſee that all men doe die, all men weep, that all men are full of ſorrow, that all men complaine, and that all men liue in feare. If wee could happily meet with any man now adaies vvho would bind himſelfe to keepe vs from theſe griefes, and cure vs of theſe feares, vvhat vvould vvee denie him, or vvhat vvould vvee not giue him? If we pay bountifully and bee thankfull vnto the Phiſitian, vvho doth cure vs of one griefe, vvhat ſhould vvee pay or giue him, or what thankes ſhould vvee render vnto him, who vvould cure vs of all? <hi>Verè languores noſtros ipſe pertulit, &amp; dolores noſtres ipſe portauit,</hi> ſayth <hi>Eſayas,</hi> chapter, 54. As if hee would ſay, The Redeemer of the vvorld, and the heire of all eternities vvas he vvho tooke our infirmities vpon himſelfe, and did load and burthen himſelfe with all our griefes &amp; ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. In old time <hi>Eſculapius</hi> the inuenter of Phiſick was much ſet by; the Greekes eſteemed of <hi>Hipocrates</hi> their firſt Phiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; the Thebanes of <hi>Anthony Muſa</hi> their firſt ſurgeon; and the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:3666:157"/>Romanes of <hi>Archagnatus</hi> their firſt Phiſitian, whome they adored for a time like an Idoll, and in the end ſtoned him in <hi>Campus Martius.</hi> The Greekes, the Romanes, the Thebans had neuer ſuch a Phiſitian as wee Chriſtians haue of Chriſt: for all other Phiſitions of the vvorld can but counſell vs, but our great Phiſition hath ſcience to counſell, experience to cure, and power to heale. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth, There was neuer any ſuch manner of curing in the world as Chriſt brought with him, becauſe that all other Phiſitions before his time, if they found any man ſicke, they left him ſicke, and if they found him in paine, they left him in paine: but holy Ieſus did neuer lay his band vpon any that was diſeaſed, but hee left him whole. <hi>Hilarius</hi> ſayth, Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Goſpell ſaith of Chriſt, <hi>Totum hominem ſaluum fecit,</hi> bee ſpake it not ſo much for cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall infirmities, as hee did for ſpirituall diſeaſes, the which are woont to proceed, not of corrupted humours, but of ſinnes vvhich had taken root. S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſayth, The ſonne of God did then heale me of all my griefes, when he tooke them vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelfe: for ſeeing that they had ſuch poſſeſsion of me, &amp; ſo long time rooted and wxt old in me, how was it poſsible that any man ſhould take them from me, if hee had not caſt them vpon himſelfe? Hee did caſt my death vpon himſelfe, when he did die vpon the croſſe, hee did caſt my ſorrow vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelfe when he was in his agonie, he did caſt my teares vpon himſelfe vvhen hee did vveepe for my ſinnes, hee did load my griefe vpon his owne backe when hee did taſte vineger and gaule, and hee did take my feare vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelfe, when he did feare death like a man. When a temporall Phiſitian commeth to viſite a ſicke perſon, hee dooth comply with him by taking him by the pulſe, and by giuing him a regiment of life, and if hee find him to haue an ague hee leaueth him vvith it, inſomuch that they may better bee called counſellours, ſeeing they doe giue counſell onely, than Phiſitians, ſeeing they cure not. God forbid that any ſuch thing ſhould bee ſaid of our Phiſitian, ſeeing that from the time that he came down from
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:3666:157"/>heauen to cure the world, he himſelfe became ſicke, &amp; cured him who was ſick, and he who was ſicke did riſe vp aliue, and the Phiſitian remained there dead; and the reaſon of that was, becauſe he changed the health which he brought with him, with the ſickneſſe which the other had. O that this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change was a glorious and happy exchange which thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt make with me, good Ieſus, ſeeing that thou didſt change thy goodneſſe for my naughtineſſe, thy clemency for my iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, thy health for my infirmity, thy innocency for my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and thy paine and puniſhment for my fault! And becauſe we haue made mention before of fiue notable paines &amp; euils, with the which all mortall men are beaten and afflicted, it is reaſon that wee ſee in this place how the ſonne of God did bear our weakneſſes, vnburdening vs of them, and burdening himſelfe with them. <hi>Verè languores noſtros ipſe pertulit,</hi> when he ſaid in the garden of Gethſemani, my ſoule is heauy vnto death: for with thoſe dolefull words, he loaded his ſoule w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>h my heauineſſe, and did vnload vpon me all his ioy. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did our ioy begin but in his greateſt ſorrow? So long as God did not know by experience what ſorrow was, we did neuer know what mirth was; and from that day that hee began to weepe, we began to laugh. Hee did truly take our infirmiries vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, when good Ieſus vpon his knees in the garden ſaid vnto his Father, <hi>Tranſeat a me calix iſte:</hi> for in that agonie hee did caſt all my feare vpon himſelfe, to the end that I ſhould afterward be leſſe timorous. Before that God tooke fleſh he was feared of all men, and did feare no man, and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man did feare all things, and was feared of no body: but ſince the time that Chriſt like a fearefull man ſaid, my ſoule is ſorrowfull and heauy, there is no reaſon that we ſhould fear any thing, for his feare was ſufficient to make all the world couragious S. <hi>Barnard</hi> vpon that ſaying, <hi>Cum ipſo ſum in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulatione</hi> ſayth Seeing that thou doeſt bind thy ſelfe, O good Ieſus, by theſe words to be alwaies at hand with me, and to be by my ſide when I ſhall be afflicted and perſecuted, why, or for what cauſe, or whereof ſhould I bee afeard? There is no
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:3666:158"/>cauſe to feare the fleſh, ſeeing that thou diddeſt make thy ſelfe fleſh: there is no cauſe to feare the deuill, ſeeing that thou haſt ouercome him: there is no cauſe to feare ſinne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt brought it to an end: there is no cauſe to feare the world, becauſe thou haſt ouercome it: there is no cauſe to feare man, ſeeing thou haſt redeemed him; neither will I feare thee O my good Ieſus, but loue thee. Before that thou diddeſt make thy ſelfe man, I was man who did feare; &amp; now I am he who is feared: ſinne doth feare mee becauſe I admit him not: the fleſh feareth mee becauſe I cheriſh him not: the diuell feareth me becauſe I beleeue him not: and the world feareth me, becauſe I follow him not. He did then truly take our infirmities vpon him, when as vpon the altar of the croſſe he did crie with a loud voice and many teares, and when hee praied and ſhed many teares, with the which hee did waſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our offences. He did then take our infirmities vpon him, when as in the laſt houre he did yeeld vp his ghoſt, <hi>Inclinato capite,</hi> accepting the death which his Father did offer him, to transferre life into vs. <hi>Damaſcen</hi> ſayth, From what time did we looſe the ſhame of death, but ſince Chriſt did fear death? No man ought to maruell that the ſonne of God did feare death, but that which we ſhould maruell at is, that hee made his martyrs not feare death, and that they ſhould goe ſo free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to death, ſeeing that they goe more cheerefully to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred, than Princes doe goe to be crowned. The ſonne then doth complaine vnto his Father, ſaying, Why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me, becauſe that hauing take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our infirmities, ſinnes, and ſorrowes vpon himſelfe, it is no reaſon that wee ſhould bee ſo vngratefull and vnthankfull vnto him.</p>

The Scripture declaring the great hatred which <hi>Iacobs</hi> eleuen ſons bare vnto their brother <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> ſpeaketh theſe words: and the meaning is this, The elder brothers did hate the yong very much, becauſe his father did loue him beſt, and make moſt of him; and their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and enuy grew to that depth, that they could not endure to ſee him, nor ſpeake one friendly word vnto him. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> thought that enuy was the root and foundation of the perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mankind, ſeeing hee ſayth, that <hi>Propter inuidiam mors intrauit in mundum:</hi> and therefore it ſhall be great reaſon that we declare what enuie is, and what hurt it doth, and who is Queene of enuy. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſayth, That enuy is nothing elſe but a paſsion of the mind, &amp; a mortall anguiſh to ſee another man in credite and honour, imagining that to be his diſcredit. <hi>Horace</hi> ſayth, The greateſt griefe that we haue with enuy is, that it is not in the eies, for ſo it would bee ſeene, nor in the hands, for it would bee felt, nor in the tongue, for it would bee heard, but his chaire and ſeat is in the ſecreteſt place of the heart and mind, where it abideth, complaining of euery man, and tormenting him who poſſeſſeth it. <hi>Menander</hi> ſaith, The mother of enuie is ſwelling pride, and curſed ambition, and therefore they neuer goe aſunder, or very ſeldome, but where pride is there is enuy, and where enuy, there pride. S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> ſayth, Take away enuy, and preſently all that is mine, is thine, and all that is thine is mine. <hi>Origen</hi> ſayth, Enuy doth grow ſo faſt vpon me by reaſon of the diſordinate loue which I beare vnto my owne perſon: for thereby I beare malice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my inferiors for feare leaſt they become my equals, and I enuy my equals leaſt they goe beyond mee, and I ſpight my ſuperiors becauſe they doe me no good. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> in a Sermon ſayth, That the difference betwixt a malicious man, and an enuious man is, that the malicious man doth loue nothing but that that is naught, and the enuious man doth hate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:3666:159"/>but that which is good. S. <hi>Gregory</hi> in the fift booke of his Morals ſayth, The naughty man doth enuy none but ſuch as he ſeeth in higher eſtate than himſelfe, or whom hee ſeeth to bee of better life than himſelfe, or whome hee heareth bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpoken off than himſelfe: whereof it inſueth, that how much the other doth grow &amp; encreaſe in goodneſſe, ſo much the enuious man doth vexe and torment himſelfe. <hi>Iſidorus</hi> ſayth, Take heed of enuy, my brother, take heed; for it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a certaine diſeaſe which doth trouble thy ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, burneth thy breaſt, gnaweth thy bowels, grindeth thy heart, waſteth thy life, darkeneth thy memory, and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth thy ſoule. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayth, That a man doth ſeldome enuy him whom he can ouercome, but him whom he cannot van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh. And the ſelfeſame <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayth further, It is more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for vs to beware of the enuy of our friends, than of the hatred and diſpleaſure of our enemies, becauſe the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my carrieth his hatred in his tongue, and I take heed of him: but becauſe my friend hideth his enuy in his heart, it cannot be known, nor I cannot beware of him. <hi>Laertius</hi> ſaith, I would to God, that all enuious men had their eies ſcattered ouer all the world, that becauſe other mens goods and welfare is a torment vnto them, they might bee tormented with ſo many tortures, as they ſee other mens hap and felicity encreaſe. <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> ſayth, There hath no man liued in this world in fame and credite, but hee hath preſently felt the worme of enuy; whereof it followeth, that the poor and miſerable man doth only eſcape the enuious mans hands. <hi>Demosthenes</hi> in an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſayth, What ſhall I doe wretched man as I am, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall I goe? For if I deſire to liue in pouerty, miſery doth weary me; and if I chuſe to be rich, enuie doth torment mee. To come then vnto our purpoſe, all this diſcourſe hath ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto no other end, but to admoniſh all men of honeſt life, and of a cleane conſcience; to beware of enny, becauſe the Deuill is ſuch a friend vnto this vice, that if hee ſee a man to bee very enuious, hee will tempt him with no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſinne. <hi>Cicero</hi> ſayth, What hath cauſed all the vvarres

Although Chriſt vvas poore, yet hee vvas hated of the vvicked, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of malice, and perſecuted vvith enuy. But his pouertie being ſo great as it was, and hiding his power as he did, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhould any man enuie him? They did not enuy Chriſt for the feature of his body, ſeeing there vvere other beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full alſo, nor for his ſtocke and kindred, ſeeing there vvere others noble alſo; not for his eloquence, ſeeing there were others learned, nor for his vvealth, ſeeing there vvere o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more vvealthy; but that vvhich they did moſt of all enuy at vvas, his Catholicke doctrine vvhich hee did preach, and holy life which hee did lead, becauſe that none of the Prophets vvhich vvent before him, did preach of ſuch high points as hee did, nor yet any one of them did liue ſo ſincerely as hee did. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> vpon thoſe words, <hi>Sciebat enim quod per inuidiam tradidiſſent eum</hi> ſayth, The enuy conceiued againſt good life, is more dangerous than that vvhich is bred by reaſon of our vvealth: for if hee bee a naughtie man vvhich is poſſeſſed of this vvealth, hee vvill endeuour himſelfe rather to encreaſe his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, than amend his life. Let vs compare then the enuie vvhich <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſonnes bare vnto their brother <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> vvith the enuie vvhich they did beare vnto Chriſt, and vvee ſhall ſee how vvell the figure dooth anſwere vnto the thing figured, and the ſpirit vnto the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſeeing that the one vvas fold by enuie into Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt, and the other alſo through enuie crucified. <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> did miſlike his brothers doings, and therefore they did enuie him; and Chriſt did not like the Iewes do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and therefore they did hate him: and they did perſecute <hi>Ioſeph</hi> becauſe hee did accuſe them before their father; and enuied Chriſt becauſe hee did reprehend them before the people. The Iewes malice towards Chriſt vvas greater than <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brothers againſt him; for <hi>Ioſeph</hi>
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:3666:160"/>was onely ſold, but innocent Ieſus was not onely ſold, but alſo crucified. <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brothers could not giue him one faire word, neither could the Iewes hear Chriſts doctrine with patience: and therefore if his diuine prouidence ſhould not haue kept him from their fury, they had taken Chriſts life long before away from him. <hi>Nolunt audire te, quiae nolunt audire me filij ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis, quia omnis Iſrael eſt attrita fronte, &amp; duro corde,</hi> ſaid God vnto the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel:</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, Bee not angry O <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> bee not angry, if thou perceiue that thou doeſt no good with thy ſpeech, and haſt no credite among them: for ſeeing that they doe not beleeue me, it is not to bee maruelled though they doe not heare thee: for the houſe of Iſrael is growne now vnto that madneſſe, that it hath neither conſcience in her ſoule, nor ſhame in her face. Theſe are the words of the eternall Father, directed vnto his bleſſed ſon, letting him vnderſtand by them what ſmall fruit hee ſhould reape by his doctrine, and what ſmal credite they would giue vnto his ſpeech; &amp; the reaſon is, becauſe that all thoſe which were of the houſe of Iſrael were inwardly without a good ſpirit, and outwardly without ſhame. According vnto this ſpeech of the Prophet ſuch Prelates as gouern &amp; preach, do toile &amp; labor exceedingly, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſubiects which heare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are a people without any conſcience, &amp; of leſſe ſhame. For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that they do no good among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, there is alſo great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to liue among them. <hi>Ezechiel</hi> did very well couple ſmall conſcience with ſmall ſhame, and ſmall ſhame with a ſmall conſcience, becauſe that you ſhall neuer or very ſildome ſee a ſhameleſſe man, but hee is without conſcience, nor a man without conſcience but is alſo ſhameleſſe. Wickedneſſe for wickedneſſe, and ſinne for ſin, A Chriſtian can haue no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſinnes than to bee obſtinate in heart, and without ſhame in his face, becauſe that hell is full of none but of ſuch as are of an obſtinate heart and impudent countenance. The man which is of a tender and ſoft heart, and ſhamefaſt in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, is eaſily amended, and doth now and then ſinne by ſtealth; but he who is hard harted &amp; ſhameleſſe in condition,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:3666:160"/>doth late or neuer amend his ſinne, becauſe he careth not for being counted a ſinner. When Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Gaudete &amp; exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, quia nomina veſtra ſcripta ſunt in caelis,</hi> he gaue vs heence to be glad of nothing, but only that we were good Chriſtians, and regiſtred in the booke of Saints; and likewiſe that wee ſhould be ſorry of nothing ſo much, as to be naughty Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and blotted out of the booke of life: for he was borne in an euill houre, who doth not endeuour to amend his life, and doth not care at all to ſinne. We ſpeake all this to proue that the Iewes vvere of a ſhameleſſe forehead and hard hearted, ſeeing that <hi>Pilate</hi> did know plainely, that they did accuſe Chriſt through enuy and malice, which hee gathered by the ſhameleſſe ſpeeches which they vſed againſt Chriſt, and the falſe proofes which they alledged againſt him. <hi>Facta eſt fames magna in Samaria, ita vt caput aſini vaenundaretur octoginta ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genteis,</hi> 4 Reg. 6. The Scripture rehearſeth this, to ſhew the great miſery and diſtreſſe that Samaria was in, as if it would ſay, When Samaria vvas at warres with the Arabians, being beſieged and afflicted with famine, an aſſe head vvas worth foureſcore rials, and a certaine meaſure of Pigeons dung fiue rials, ſo that they had no meat to eat but aſſes, and nothing to dreſſe it with but Pigeons dung. Although the fleſh of an aſſe bee lothſome to eat, and Pigeons dung filthy to burne, yet notwithſtanding vvee vvill draw ſome myſtery of this figure, to aduance Chriſts honour by it, becauſe there is no word in holy Scripture which hath not ſome ſecret hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vnder it. In this figure of the aſſe is repreſented the great warre that Chriſt found in mans nature. What other thing was the warre vvhich Samaria had vvith the king of Arabia, but the diſpleaſure &amp; anger which God had againſt the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue? What was the great dearth &amp; famine which they endured, but the exceeding want which they had of good doctrine? What did it meane that an aſſes head was ſold ſo deerly, but only that a good man was little worth, &amp; a naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty man highly eſteemed? By the Pigeons dung wherewith they did dreſſe the aſſes head, is meant nothing elſe but the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:3666:161"/>Moſaicall ceremonies with the which they did offer vp their ſacrifices. There fell nothing vnto the Synagogues lot but the dregs, and the wine vnto the church; to the Synagogue the barke, and vnto the church the fruit; the thorne vnto the Synagogue, and the roſe vnto the church; the Pigeons dung to the Synagogue, and to vs the Pigeon. The warre betwixt God and mans nature, was farre more cruell, than that which was betwixt the city of Samaria and the king of Arabia, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men did nothing but ſight with God with their ſinnes, and God did nothing vnto man but inflict puniſhment vpon him. If they aske the ſonne of God why hee came into this world, and took humane fleſh vpon him, he will anſwer them, that his comming was to relieue this famine, and appeaſe this warre, in teſtimony whereof the Angels in heauen did ſing, when Chriſt was borne, Peace, Peace; ſeeing that I am a meane between you, there muſt be no more anger left. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſonne of God came into the world, the warre ceaſed, and when he began to preach, the famine began to ceaſe, becauſe that this famine, which humane nature was afflicted with, was not cauſed for want of corporall food, but for want of vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. The want of victuals dured in Samaria but the ſpace of one yeare, but the want of vertuous men continued in the Synagogue from the time of the valerous Machabeans vntill the comming of Chriſt: for from that time vntill Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, they had no Prophet to giue them light, no captaine to defend them, no Prieſt to teach them, nor any other famous man to reioice in. Who did euer find a greater dearth in the world than that which Chriſt found among the Iewes? See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he found the princely ſcepter broken, the prieſthood at an end, the Temple robbed, the city peruerted, and her li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie loſt? There was a great dearth in the Synagogue, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that there was not in her one perſon of account. For he did not chuſe the twelue Apoſtles for his companions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were holy, but becauſe hee meant to make them holy. There was a great famine in Samaria, ſeeing the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was <hi>Pilate,</hi> who was a Tyrant, the biſhop was <hi>Cayphas,</hi>

How was it poſsible that there ſhould bee any good in a Commonwealth, which was gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſuch naughty gouernours? As in the vnfortunate Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria they had no kine nor calues left, ſo alſo the Synagogues Patriarkes and Prophets were at an end, and that which was worſt of all was, that as Samaria was conſtrained to feed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on aſſes heads, ſo the Synagogue was forced to bee gouerned by naughty and wicked men. Wee doe not ſay much in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they were gouerned by wicked men: for wee might with good reaſon call them aſſes, ſeeing they had no diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to know that vvhich was good, nor wiſedome to eſchew that vvhich vvas naught. Doeſt thou not thinke that <hi>Pilate</hi> the iudge vvas a very aſſe, ſeeing hee confeſſed before them all, that hee found no cauſe to put Chriſt to death, and yet <hi>Tradidit illum voluntati eorum?</hi> Thou doeſt confeſſe, <hi>Pilate,</hi> that Chriſt was vvithout fault: and yet doeſt thou condemne him to die? Was not the High-prieſt <hi>Cayphas</hi> a very aſſe, to ſay that Chriſt blaſphemed, becauſe hee ſaid that hee would come to iudge the vvorld? Art thou iudge of the vvorld which is not thine, and vvilt thou not let him iudge the vvorld vvho hath created it? Was not, thinkeſt thou, King <hi>Herod</hi> a great aſſe for clothing Chriſt in fooles apparrell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Chriſt vvould not giue him an anſwere, ſeeing that for that act hee ſhould rather haue accounted him wiſe than otherwiſe? Wherein could the ſonne of God haue better ſhowne his diſcretion and patience, than in not anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vnto any iniury, and in not miſgouerning himſelfe in any word? Was not all the vvhole congregation and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of the Iewes, a very aſſe in thy opinion, in that they did crie for libertie for <hi>Barrabas,</hi> and procured that Chriſt ſhould die? The Synagogue did not buy <hi>Barrabas</hi> life ſo good cheape, as Samaria did the aſſes head, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the aſſes head was bought for money, but <hi>Barrabas</hi> life
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:3666:162"/>did coſt Chriſt his bloud. It was not worth ſo much, and yet they gaue more in Samaria for an aſſes head, than they did for Chriſts bloud in Ieruſalem, ſeeing they gaue but thirty pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of money for Chriſt, and foureſcore for the aſſes head. To ſpeake morally then; men buy the aſſes head deerely, when they chuſe for the gouernour of a Commonwealth, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, a ſimple and vndiſcreet man; becauſe that in all canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call elections, the learned is to bee preferred before the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the wiſe before the vndiſcreet. There muſt needs be a great famine in that monaſtery, in which they chuſe for their head, ſuch a one as is light in behauiour, baſe in linage, a foole in his iudgement, &amp; an aſſe in his conſcience. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet did not ſay in vaine, <hi>Cum ſancto ſanctus eris, &amp; cum peruerſo peruerteris;</hi> For a wiſe man can bring vp but wiſe men, a wicked man nothing but wicked men, and an aſſe none but aſſes. O thou whoſoeuer thou art who doeſt hear or read this, doe not thinke that we call thoſe aſſes who haue but ſmall or no learning, but thoſe which haue no conſcience, nor no brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vp: for he is often fitter to gouern who hath great experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence &amp; diſcretion, than hee who is full of knowledge &amp; folly. We do not call him an aſſe who is ignorant in Logick, &amp; Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, and Diuinity, becauſe that in Vniuerſities men learn rather to diſpute than gouerne, make Sillogiſmes, than rule ſubiects. When a Prelate is vnpleaſant in his conuerſation, hard in charity, variable in his opinion, ſlacke in iuſtice, negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in praier, theſe we call aſſes, and vnworthy of ſuch a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; for, for my owne part, I had rather my Prelate ſhould be experienced in gouernement, than skilfull in learning and knowledge.</p>

If wee will curiouſly ſeeke out the meaning of this figure, we ſhall find that it containeth a deepe myſterie, pertaining directly vnto our purpoſe, becauſe it ſheweth how ſoone our redemption began in Chriſt. That two children haue been borne at one birth wee haue ſeene often, and that one ſhould be borne before the other we haue alſo heard: but that the one ſhould haue his finger tied and not the other, is a thing that hath neuer been ſeene nor hard of; and therefore by how much the thing is more rare, by ſo much it is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of myſtery and ſecret. Deepely then expounding this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, who were the two children born at one birth, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the humane &amp; diuine nature, which ſaued the world? The two children whoſe names were <hi>Phares</hi> and <hi>Zaram</hi> did know no other mother but <hi>Thamar,</hi> and the diuine and humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did acknowledge no other father but God: for as it is an eaſie matter for a father to haue many childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſo it is a hard &amp; impoſsible thing for Chriſt to haue many fathers. Although thoſe two children were very naturall, and neere brothers the one to the other, and of one belly, yet they were neuer ſov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited together, as the diuine and humane nature was vnited in Chriſt, becauſe theſe two were neuer ſeperated in Chriſt in his life, nor ſeuered at his death vpon the croſſe. And as one of theſe two children was borne before the other, ſo the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer of the world was firſt God before hee was man, and was firſt born of his Father, according to his diuinity, than he was of his mother, according to his humanity. We know well that of the two brothers <hi>Phares</hi> and <hi>Zaram,</hi> the one was born after the other: but the diuine birth was ſo farre before the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:3666:163"/>that we find no beginning of it, becauſe it was <hi>Ab aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no.</hi> Of theſe two brothers the firſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was borne in health, pure and cleane, and without any marke at all, to giue vs to vnderſtand, that Chriſts firſt birth, which was his diuinity, did returne againe as whole, faire, and clean to heauen, as it came from heauen; becauſe it is the natural condition of the diuine eſſence, that how much the ſtraiter his power is ioined vnto it, ſo much the ſtranger and further it is from all kind of ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. What did it mean that the other brother was born with a coloured thred tied about his finger, but that Chriſt ſhould ſhed his bloud for the redemption of all the world? O good Ieſus, O redemption of my ſoule! thou doeſt ſee well, that to come out of thy mothers wombe with thy finger tied, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but to come into the world condemned to death. <hi>Zaram</hi> onely, who was the figure, and the ſonne of God, who was the thing figured, were thoſe who had their finger tied with a coloured thred, becauſe he and no other was to die for the world, and redeeme vs out of ſinne. What other meaning had the thred of ſcarlet, ſauing onely the ſhedding of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious bloud? The difference betwixt thee, O my ſweet Ieſus, and other condemned perſons is this, that they are tied in a hempen cord, and thou in a thred of ſcarlet, and they about the necke, and thou about the finger, and they are lead to be hanged, and thou to be crucified. A thiefe is led away bound with a great tope, becauſe he is drawne to death by force, but the ſonne of God is tied with a ſmall fine thred, becauſe hee dieth not by force, but of his owne free will: for if it were not his good pleaſure ſo to doe, neither the Angels, nor men, nor the diuels were able to put him to death. O high myſtery, O diuine Sacrament! who euer ſaw or heard, that before a child were borne, or knew what ſinne was, yet that he ſhould come out of his mothers wombe already condemned? What mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy can be compared vnto this, that before his mother ſhould giue him milke to ſucke, his owne father threatened him that he ſhould die crucified? <hi>Elegit ſuſpendium anima mea, &amp; oſſa mea mortem, &amp; nequaquam vltra iam viuam,</hi> ſaith <hi>Iob</hi> chap. 7.

Such pittifull complaines as theſe are, and ſuch tender vvordes, cannot proceed but from an afflicted and grieued heart, and from a man which deſireth death. Becauſe it is the property of one which is diſtreſſed, to complaine vnto all thoſe which comfort him, &amp; fill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with weeping with all thoſe which come to viſite him. What elſe would holy <hi>Iob</hi> ſay, when he ſayth, <hi>Elegit ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium anima mea, &amp; oſſa mea mortem,</hi> but that his ſoule deſired to bee hanged, and his bones chuſe death, and his life to bee at an end? O holy man, thou haſt nothing left thee but thy ſoule, and wouldeſt thou haue it hanged, nothing left but thy bones, and doeſt thou deſire to haue them dead, thou haſt nothing left but thy life, and vvouldeſt thou looſe it? Thou muſt vnderſtand, my good brother, that <hi>Iob</hi> did not ſpeake theſe dolefull vvordes in his owne name, but in Chriſts name, vnto vvhome this ſpeech dooth moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belong.

When the Scripture ſayth <hi>Elegit,</hi> Hee did chuſe, it is ſignified that thou diddeſt die willingly for vs: and when he ſaith <hi>Suſpendium,</hi> his death was ſignified, and withall his determination which he had to redeeme the world, and that our redemption ſhould be hanged vpon the tree. And vvhen he ſayth, <hi>Oſſa mea,</hi> the multitude of people is ſet forth which were at his death, as well the good as the bad, the quicke as the dead: the good, to ſee themſelues redeemed by him, and the bad to ſee themſelues reuenged of him. All humane pains are brought vnto three principall heads, that is, to the trouble and trauell of the body, to the griefe and ſorrow of the mind, and to the loſſe of life. Theſe vexations are woont to happen at diuerſe times, and alſo be deuided and laid vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on diuerſe perſons, and hee who hath griefe of body fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth no ſorrow of mind, and if hee haue anguiſh of mind yet not ſo great that it ſhould take his life from him, becauſe our Lord is ſo pittiful that hee dooth not looke vnto the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of our offences, but vnto the vveakeneſſe of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. God was more pittifull vvith all mankind than vvith his owne only ſonne, conſidering that hee gaue other men their troubles and paines by peeces, and vnto his ſonne all at once. For hee gaue him ſorrow and griefe of mind, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hee ſayth, My ſoule hath choſen to bee hanged: and hee gaue him the paines of the body, ſeeing hee ſayth, that his bones deſired death: and hee tooke away his life conſidering that hee ſayth, <hi>Iam non viuam.</hi> What vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable ſorrow, and what ſea of tempeſt ſhould toſſe and vexe that bleſſed ſoule vvhen hee ſaid, My ſoule hath choſen to bee hanged, that is, that it vvould bee a comfort vnto him to bee crucified! What cruell griefe ſhould cruſh
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:3666:164"/>his bones when hee ſaid, and my bones death, thinking it an eaſe to ſee his bones in their graue, rather than to ſuffer ſuch intollerable torment? What a ieſt did they make of his doctrine, and how little did they regard his perſon, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hee ſayth, I vvill liue no longer, that is, that hee vvould forſake vs, becauſe vvee are incorrigible, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe vvee doe not deſerue his company, hee vvill not beſtow his grace among vs. This ſpeech may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe bee very vvell vnderſtood, becauſe the time vvhich hee did ſuffer and die in did take from him all that might mittigate his paine, and comfort his heart. No other Martyr could euer ſay, My ſoule hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen hanging, becauſe there vvas none of them vvhich vvanted comfort in their ſorrows, and helpe in their pains; and aboue all, this vvas a great comfort to them to thinke for how good a maiſter they ſuffered, and vvhat a great reward they expected for their martyrdome. That vvhich did comfort Martyrs in their Martyrdome, did diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort Chriſt in his paſsion. For if hee did die, it vvas for a loſt and peruerſe nation, and the reward hee loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for was perpetuall ingratitude; becauſe there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo great a matter performed, as when Chriſt died becauſe vve ſhould liue, and yet there vvas neuer deed ſo vngratefully requited, as his death was by vs. Saint <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> ſayth, O good Ieſus, O my ſoules ioy, Art thou not content to looſe thy life for my life, but that thy ſorrow and griefe ſhould continue alſo vntill they take thy ſoule from thee vpon the croſſe? If the ſonne of God had ſaid only, <hi>Triſtis est anima mea,</hi> it had beene tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: but to ſay, <hi>Vſque ad morte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> it is a thing not to be any way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured: For it was only he and no other, in whom the paine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the ſame time that his ſoule departed from him. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> ſaith, That by this ſpeech, <hi>Vſque ad mortem,</hi> the ſon of God dooth bind himſelfe to die ſorrowfully and comfortles, taking no eaſe at all in his paſsion, becauſe there was no porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the inferiour part, which griefe did not wholly poſſeſſe,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:3666:165"/>nor any bone in all his bodie vvhich vvas not bruſed and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with griefe and paine. Chriſt ſayth, <hi>Eleg it ſuſpendium a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima mea,</hi> becauſe that as all the time that hee liued in this vvorld, hee kept the glory of his ſoule in ſuſpence, becauſe it ſhould not fall vpon his body; ſo at the time of his paſsion hee did keepe his reaſon in ſuſpence, becauſe it ſhould not comfort his ſoule. For if Chriſt vvould haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen his glorious ſoule licenſe to impart ſome ſmall ſparkle of her glory vnto the body, hee had neuer been comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe; and if hee would haue giuen licenſe vnto his reaſon to haue comforted him in his paſsion, hee ſhould neuer haue felt his paſsion ſo ſharpe and bitter. But becauſe our redemption ſhould bee more copious and aboundant, hee would admit no comfort nor conſolation at all. <hi>Ne fortitudo lapidum fortitudo mea, nee caro mea,</hi> ſayth ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Iob;</hi> As if hee vvould ſay, O great God, doe not puniſh mee ſo rigorouſly, nor ſhew thy ſelfe ſo cruell againſt mee, becauſe my heart is not ſo hard as a ſtone to feele no paine, nor my fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Hee who ſpake theſe words, did craue aid for his griefe, and fauour for his anguiſh, ſeeing hee did confeſſe that his heart vvas not able to beare them, nor his ſtrength able to ſuſtaine them. There are ſome men ſo ſenceleſſe that they feele no kind of tribulation no more than if their hearts vvere made of ſtone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and contrary there are ſome of ſo tender a nature, that if a man doe but touch their coat, they crie out that they may bee heard vnto heauen, in ſo much that the firſt like vnto beaſts feele nothing, and the other like impatient men neuer ceaſe crying. When the holy man ſayth, That his heart vvas not like a heart of ſtone, hee meant that hee did feele all tribulation and anguiſh, euen vnto the heart: and vvhen hee ſaid that his fleſh vvas not made of copper or braſſe, his meaning was, that although he did feele all tribulation, yet hee did neuer complaine of it; in ſo much that if hee did feele it as a man, yet hee
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:3666:165"/>did diſſemble it like a wiſe man. S. <hi>Gregory</hi> in his Morals ſaith, <hi>Iob</hi> doth very wiſely vnder theſe vvords ſhew vs the manner how bad men and good men doe ſuffer their anguiſh, and hee compareth thoſe which feele no tribulation vnto a ſtone, and thoſe which complaine on them alwaies, vnto ſounding cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: for indeed hee who feeleth no griefe at all, is like vnto a ſtone, and to feele it and hold his peace is the part of him who is wiſe and diſcreet. Chriſts heart vvas not of ſtone, becauſe hee ſhould not feele, neither was his fleſh of copper, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine: for hee did feele all paine and anguiſh more than any man, and did ſuffer it better than any; for in all the time of his paſsion he did neuer complaine vpon any when hee ſuffered, nor did neuer command a reuenge to bee taken on any when he died.</p>

It is an ordinary thing to ſee one man complaine vpon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to ſee me complaine vpon my ſelfe is no new thing, but to complaine on thee and my ſelfe at once, is a hard caſe: for although my tongue can count my griefes and tribulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet my heart cannot ſuffer them. If Chriſt did complaine of <hi>Herod</hi> for mocking him, or of <hi>Pilate</hi> for giuing ſentence on him, it was no maruell; but to complaine on his Father, it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that there is no patience able to endure it. For ſeeing
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:3666:166"/>that hee ſhould haue defended him, it ſeemeth a very hard part to ſuffer him to bee crucified. The ſonne of God dooth frame two great complaints in theſe wordes, the one of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Father, the other of himſelfe: and therefore it is very conuenient that we declare how the eternall Father did ſend his ſonne to die, and how hee himſelfe went to ſuffer on the croſſe: and in ſo doing, wee ſhall find that the one did that which hee did, moued therevnto with charity, and the other to ſuffer that which hee ſuffered, was mooued with pitty. <hi>Qui proprio filio non pepercis, ſed pro omnibus nobistradidit illum,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul:</hi> and his meaning is this, The loue which God bare vnto all the world, was ſo exceeding great, that he would not pardon the death of his owne proper ſonne, but would haue him crucified for all. Being, as he was, his naturall ſonne, &amp; his only ſonne, and ſo holy a ſonne, and ſo welbeloued a ſonne, was it not a thing moſt wonderfull that hee would ſuffer him to be crucified? <hi>Dauid</hi> had many ſonnes beſides <hi>Abſalon,</hi> and yet when the captaine <hi>Ioab</hi> had ſlaine him in field, <hi>Dauid</hi> was almoſt beſides himſelfe, and cried out, O my ſonne <hi>Abſalon,</hi> O my ſonne <hi>Abſalon,</hi> who will doe mee the fauour to kill me, and reſtore me thee again? He that gaue ſuch ſorrowful words for the death of a ſonne, would he not, thinke you, haue pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out farre more pittifull lamentations, if he had been han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled, as Chriſt was crucified? To haue killed a ſeruant for to ſaue his ſonne, any Father would haue done; but to kill his ſonne for to ſaue his ſeruant, onely the Father of Chriſt did, who hauing no other ſonne but him, gaue them him as freely to be carried to be crucified, as if they had led him to be crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. <hi>Damaſcen</hi> ſayth, The eternall Father did well know, that our buſineſſe could not bee brought to paſſe, but by his ſonnes meanes; and he knew alſo very well, that ſo old a ſtrife would coſt his ſonne very deerely, and notwithſtanding all this he gaue his full conſent that hee ſhould bee condemned to die. And that which moſt of all did ſhew his goodneſſe, and our wickedneſſe is, that the diuels, againſt whome he did plead &amp; ſtriue, did not giue ſentence againſt Chriſt, but man
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:3666:166"/>for whom hee did plead, and whoſe cauſe he did defend. <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophilus</hi> dooth ſeeme to ſay, that it importeth more to ſay, that the father did ſuffer his ſonne to bee crucified, than to ſay that hee doth ſuffer ſinne: which appeareth by the Apoſtle, when hee ſayth, <hi>Quòd pro nobu omnibus tradidit illum:</hi> and hee ſayth not, <hi>Quòd permiſit,</hi> but hee ſayth that hee did deliuer and giue his ſonne to bee crucified. If the father did giue him to be crucified, who was able to defend him? If we doe giue credite vnto the Prophet <hi>Eſayas,</hi> the ſonne dooth charge no man with his death and paſsion ſauing only his Father, ſeeing that hee ſayth in the Fathers name, <hi>Propter peccata populi mei percuſsieum,</hi> as if hee would ſay, Let no ſearch bee made for the death of my ſonne, becauſe I was he who ſtroke him and wounded him, and crucified him, and buried him, becauſe the ſinnes of my people could not be clenſed, but with the bloud of my ſonne. <hi>Dauid</hi> was of the ſame opinion in the 88 Pſalm, ſaying, thou haſt ſhortened the daies of his life, &amp; haſt thrown his ſeat vpon the ground. Who was able to cut off his daies, or caſt downe his ſeat, but only he who gaue him life, and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him with a ſeat? All this was figured, not onely in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> who had drawne his ſword to kill his ſonne, but alſo in king <hi>Moab,</hi> who for the liberty of the people, did kill his own ſonne from the top of a wall. <hi>Origen</hi> vpon the Apoſtle ſayth, Although it ſeeme to be a thing againſt humanity for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be a butcher of his owne ſonne, and make an anatomy of him, yet it was no cruelty for the father to make his ſonne to die for the redemption of the world, but rather a great point of charity; becauſe it was decreed from the beginning that as our hurt came by diſobedience, ſo our bulwarke and defence ſhould bee by obedience. <hi>Theophilus</hi> ſayth, God left his ſonne in the hands of death, with an intention, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that if ſhee did ſet vpon him without cauſe, hee ſhould looſe the right which he had vpon others: and ſo it befell vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; for becauſe hee ventered vpon him who was iuſt, hee loſt his action againſt him who was a ſinner. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> vpon S. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith; There were at Chriſts death, firſt Chriſts
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:3666:167"/>father, and then the ſonne, the Lieutenant <hi>Pilate, Iudas</hi> the Diſciple, and all the people of the Iews: and as they were all of diuers conditions, ſo they were of diuers intentions. <hi>Pilate</hi> gaue ſentence on him for feare, <hi>Iudas</hi> ſold him for couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the Iews ſlew him by malice, the Father deliuered him for charity, and the ſonne offered himſelf to die with pittie: and he ſayth further, Doe not ſay, O you Iewes, doe not ſay, If hee be the ſonne of God, let him come downe from the croſſe: for you would haue crucified him long before that time, if his Father had not denied you him, &amp; afterward whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he would, and how hee vvould, hee deliuered him vnto you. What did <hi>Pilate</hi> in the death of Chriſt but ſinne, what did <hi>Iudas</hi> in the paſsion of his Maiſter but ſinne, what did the Iewes in crucifieng Chriſt but ſinne? The paſsion of Chriſt our redeemer the Father permitted, the ſonne ſuffered, the holy ghoſt approued, in ſo much that wee bee not bound for our redemption vnto thoſe who put him to death for to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge their iniuries, but vnto thoſe who ſuffered it, to redreſſe our faults. O how much we owe vnto God the Father for his clemency, ſeeing that becauſe hee would not puniſh my of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in my ſelfe, he puniſhed his own ſonne for it, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto his innocency, but vnto my great offence, the which his holy ſonne did lay vpon his owne ſhoulders, to the intent to disburden me of it. <hi>Anſelmus</hi> in his Meditations ſaith, Say, O my ſoule, ſay with the Prophet, I am he who ſinned, I am hee who haue offended thee, I am hee who hath ſinned: for the Lambe thy ſonne, what hath he done? Let thy fury bee turned againſt me, O Father, who haue committed the fault, and not againſt thy ſonne who is without ſpot, and let not the cruell ſpeare of yron pierce his heart, who can doe nothing but loue, and let him enter into my heart who can do nothing but ſinne. O fatherly affection, and fauour neuer heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore! what is there in me to giue thee, or what is there in all the world to ſerue thee with, ſeeing that for to ſeeke out him vvho vvas loſt, to redeeme him vvho vvas ſold, to vnloſe him vvho vvas bound, and deliuer him out of captiuity who was
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:3666:167"/>taken priſoner, thou diddeſt make thy owne ſonne captiue. O infinite goodneſſe, and vnſpeakable clemency! what pittie did conſtraine thee, or vvhat charity did ouercome thee, that to giue light vnto the blind, to heale the lame, put him in the right way who went aſtray, to make cleane the vncleane, to lift him vp who was fallen, and pardon him who had offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, thou wouldſt not pardon thy owne ſonne? What prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood can bee compared vnto thy Prieſthood, or what ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is like vnto thy ſacrifice, ſeeing that in old time they did offer nothing vnto the Prieſt, but ſome liue beaſt for the ſins of the people, and thou diddeſt not offer but thy own proper ſonne? The ſonne then hath great occaſion to complain of his Father, ſaying, Why haſt thou put me contrary vnto thy ſelf, ſeeing that he commanded that ſonne which hee loued beſt, to die for thoſe which moſt of all did hate him.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>Actus ſum mihimet ipſi grauis,</hi> ſayth <hi>Iob,</hi> as we haue already ſaid. Although ſaith hee, I complaine of many, yet I complaine of none more than of my ſelfe; and although many things doe wage battaile againſt me, yet I am the greateſt enemy vnto my ſelfe. <hi>Origen</hi> vpon this place ſayth, It is a thing neuer heard of, and a very ſtrange complaint: for although a man bee neuer ſo culpable, yet he deſireth to excuſe himſelfe, and accuſe others. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in a Sermon ſayth, We fall euery day and ſtumble, and ſinne: yet notwithſtanding all theſe faults, no man dooth confeſſe himſelfe to bee naught, nor acknowledge his brother to bee good. <hi>Petrarch</hi> ſayth, That men complaine of the ſea, that it is dangerous, of the aire that it is corrupt, of his friend that he is a diſſembler, of the time that it is troubleſome; and yet I ſee no man (ſayth he) who complaineth of himſelfe: &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee are like vnto young gameſters, which neuer blame
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:3666:168"/>their owne play, but when they looſe do curſe the dice. This ſpeech of <hi>Iob</hi> doth containe much matter, and therefore it is conuenient that wee tell you how many ſorts of warre there is, ſeeing he ſaith, that he maketh war againſt himſelfe. There is therefore one kind of vvarre which is called a roiall warre, another called ciuill warre, another more than ciuill vvarre, another perſonall, and another cordiall or of the heart. Of all which warres I will tell you what we haue read, and what we thinke. It is called a royall war, becauſe it is made by one king againſt another, or by one kingdome againſt another: as the warre betwixt <hi>Darius</hi> and <hi>Alexander, Troianus</hi> and <hi>Decebalus,</hi> Rome and Carthage, the which two prowd cities, although they had no kings, yet they were heads of kingdomes. There is another kind of warre called ciuill warre, which is betwixt neighbour and neighbour, or when a cittie deuideth it ſelfe, and fighteth the one againſt the other; as in Carthage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Hannones</hi> and <hi>Haſdrubales,</hi> and in Rome betwixt <hi>Scilla</hi> and <hi>Marius,</hi> and afterward betwixt <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> all which ended their liues before they ended their quarrell. There is another warre called more than ciuill warre, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſonne and the father, brother and brother, vncle and couſin; as betwixt <hi>Dauid</hi> and his ſonne <hi>Abſalon,</hi> who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to take away the kingdome from his father, although hee atchieued not his enterpriſe, but in the end was hanged vpon an oke. It was more than a ciuill warre that was betwixt the <hi>Aiaces</hi> the Greekes, <hi>Bries</hi> the Licaonians, <hi>Athenones</hi> the Troians, <hi>Fabritioes</hi> the Romanes. This is the moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous kind of warre that is, becauſe thoſe hatreds which are conceiued betwixt kinſmen, by ſo much the more are more deadly, by how much they are neerer tied in kindred. There is another kind of war which is called perſonall or a combat, vvhen two valiant men doe fight a combate for the auerring of ſome vveighty and important affaire, vvhere for to ſaue their honour they looſe ſometime their life and honour both. This kind of combate the valiant <hi>Dauid</hi> fought againſt the Giant <hi>Golias,</hi> the one armed and the
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:3666:168"/>other vvithout armes: yet in the end <hi>Dauid</hi> did ouercome <hi>Golias</hi> and killed him with his ſling, and cut off his head vvith his owne ſword. There is another kind of vvarre more ſtranger than thoſe vvee haue ſpoken of, vvhich is called the vvarre of the heart or entrals, which is begun in the heart, fought in the heart, and alſo ended in the heart. In this ſorrowfull vvarre, ſighes are the darts they caſt, tears the weapons they fight with, the bowels the field vvhere the battaile is fought, and thoſe vvho fight are the hearts, and he who can weepe beſt, is accounted the beſt ſouldiour. <hi>Factus ſum mihimet ipſi grauis,</hi> becauſe there, there fighteth one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other, and both againſt him, loue and feare, ſlouth and courage, talking and ſilence, anger and patience. O what great reaſon <hi>Iob</hi> had to ſay, <hi>Factus ſum mihimet ipſi grauis,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that not in the corners, but in the very middeſt of our hearts, theft and almes deeds doe fight and ſtriue the one againſt the other. And reaſon and ſenſuality, care and ſluggiſhneſſe, ſtrife and quietneſſe, anger and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, couetouſneſſe and liberality, pardon and reuenge. O vnhappy battaile and dangerous combate, vvhere I am made <hi>Mihimet ipſi grauis,</hi> ſeeing vvee fight heere not in company, but alone, not openly but ſecretly, not vvith ſwords but vvith thoughts, and there is nothing ſeene but all is felt. And that vvhich is vvorſt of all is, that to ouercome vvee muſt ſometimes ſuffer our ſelues to bee ouercome. Where but in this more than ciuill vvarre, in vvhat fight but in this, in vvhat ſtrife but in this, did all the holy and vertuous men end their liues? Who then will ſay that it is not very true that, <hi>Factus ſum mihimet ipſi grauis,</hi> ſeeing that we are ſo much the better accepted of God, by how much wee are contrary vnto our ſelues. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle complained of this vvarre, when hee ſaid. <hi>O infaelix ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo! quis me liberabit de corpore mortis huius?</hi> his meaning was, O vnfortunate and ſorrowfull man as I am! vvhen vvill the day come, vvherein I may ſee my ſelfe free, and as it vvere exempted from my ſelfe, to the end that
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:3666:169"/>I may doe that which I would doe, and not as now, to deſire that which I ought not. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaketh of this ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill warre in his Confeſsions, when he ſaid; <hi>Factus ſum mihimet ipſi grauis,</hi> ſeeing that I am bound and fettered, not with yrons and chains, but with my owne ſenſuality: but I gaue my vvill voluntarily vnto the Diuell, and of my vvill he maketh now that which I will not. <hi>Anſelmus</hi> in his Meditations ſayth, I am made grieuous and painfull vnto my ſelfe, becauſe there is no man ſo contrary vnto mee, and ſo againſt mee, as I am to my ſelfe, and I am like a foole beſides my ſelfe, in ſo much that liuing within my ſelfe, yet I goe wandring abroad out of my ſelfe. <hi>Iſidorus</hi> in his book <hi>De ſummo bono</hi> ſayth, I am made grieuous vnto my ſelfe, and for that cauſe my iudgement is ſo darkened, my memory ſo weakened, my thoughts ſo chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that I know not what I vvould haue although it be giuen me, nor I know not whereof I ſhould complaine although I bee demanded. Doeſt thou not thinke that my iudgement is ſore troubled, &amp; that I am an alien from myſelfe, ſeeing that I doe oftentimes, by deſiring to know that of my ſelfe that I know of others, enquire of my ſelfe for my ſelfe? <hi>Barnard</hi> ſayth in a Sermon, Am not I, good Ieſus, grieuous and painful vnto my ſelfe, ſeeing that if hunger doe make mee faint and weake, eating doth alſo loath mee, if cold doe weary me, the heat doth alſo moleſt me, if ſolitarineſſe doe make mee ſad, company doth alſo importune me, in ſo much that I am plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and contented vvith nothing, and am alwaies diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with my ſelfe? How can I bee pleaſed with my owne do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, ſeeing that if I do behaue my ſelfe once like a wiſe man, I doe behaue my ſelfe an hundred times like an vndiſcreet man? S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in an Epiſtle to <hi>Theodoſius</hi> ſayth, Becauſe I am grieuous and painefull vnto my ſelfe, I doe withdraw my ſelfe from the company of men, becauſe they ſhould not change and diſguiſe mee, I flie from the diuell becauſe hee ſhould not entrap me, I forſake the world becauſe hee ſhould not damne mee, I renounce wealth and riches, becauſe they ſhould not corrupt mee, I refuſe all honour and dignities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:3666:169"/>they ſhould not make mee prowd. But alas alas, notwithſtanding all this, and although I ſuffer very much, yet my bodie is neuer at reſt, my mind is very vnquiet, by reaſon vvhereof I grow vvorſer and vvorſer euery day in vertues, and plunge my ſelfe more and more into the world. Whoſoeuer hee vvere vvho made theſe verſes, hee made them moſt grauely:

I will iuſtly ſay, <hi>Factus ſum mihimet ipſi grauis:</hi> for if I bee in the kings diſpleaſure I forſake his countrey; if I am purſued by iuſtice, I flie from it; if I be troubled with a naughty neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, I remoue into another ſtreet: but hauing my owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per wil to my enemy, how ſhould I poſsibly flie from my ſelfe? Who will not ſay, I am made grieuous vnto my ſelfe, ſeeing that within my owne heart I harbour loue and hatred, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment and diſcontment, my will and my nill, my liking &amp; diſliking, my ioies and my griefes, and alſo my delight and my ſorrow? For my owne part, I ſay and confeſſe, that I am grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous vnto my ſelfe, conſidering that I vvillingly would that I had no ſuch vvill: for pride doth puffe mee vp, enuy dooth conſume mee, gluttony doth waſt mee, anger cauſeth mee hatred, incontinency dooth diſquiet mee, in ſo much that if I doe abſtaine from ſinne, it is not becauſe I haue not a vvill vnto it, but becauſe I am vveary and can ſinne no more. O how true it is, <hi>Quòd factus ſum mihimet ipſi grauis!</hi> for if I bee ſicke, it is becauſe I haue eaten too much, if I bee poore it is becauſe I tooke my pleaſure too much, if I
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:3666:170"/>bee impriſoned it is becauſe I haue ſtolne, if I bee ſad it is for that I loued, if I bee aſhamed it is for ſomewhat that I haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, &amp; if I be diſconte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted it is through my own choiſe; and if I haue committed an errour in my owne choiſe, whom ſhould I blame but my ſelfe? If the truth bee well examined, there is no man who ought to be more grieued with any man than with himſelfe: for as of one part we doe nothing elſe but complaine of the troubles and trauels which we ſuffer, ſo on the other part we our ſelues doe continually ſeeke them. If it be true that I am grieuous vnto my ſelfe, with whome ſhall I haue a good peace, if I my ſelfe doe make warre againſt my ſelfe? Who ſhall deale with me that I bee not grieuous and troubleſome, ſeeing that I my ſelfe cannot bee content vvith my ſelfe?

Chriſt did well know that it was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Pſalme, <hi>In ſiti mea potauerunt me aceto,</hi> ſeeing that to fulfill the Scripture he ſuffered that great thirſt, to the end that all the myſteries ſhould bee accompliſhed vvhich were prophecied of his death. The Prophets had prophecied ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:3666:171"/>things in Chriſts name which hee ſhould doe when hee came into the world; among the which they had propheci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he ſhould ſuffer very great thirſt: and therefore to ſay that he had thirſt to fulfill the Scripture, was to ſay, that hee did ſuffer that torment to vngage his vvord. Chriſt did deale like a friend with all the Prophets and holy men of old time, conſidering that to the coſt of his life, and great trauell of his holy perſon, he did accompliſh and fulfill all that which they had laid downe in Scripture, to the great credite of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and great glory of holy writ, and with the great trauell of his owne perſon. Chriſt ſaid preaching that there was no tittle, no point, nor ſentence of holy Scripture, vvhich ſhould not be fulfilled according vnto the letter. The firſt myſtery of the incarnation, <hi>Ecce virgo conciptes,</hi> was fulfilled litteral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſeeing himſelfe vvas a virgine, and borne of a virgine: and alſo the laſt myſtery of his paſsion, was accompliſhed litteral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Dederunt in eſcam meam fel, &amp; in ſiti mea potauerunt me ace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> Seeing that they gaue him vpon the croſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

What did Chriſt meane when he ſaid, that to fulfill the Scripture hee had ſuch great thirſt, but that hee might now freely depart and goe out of this vvorld, ſeeing that all the redemption was ended, and the Scripture accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed? The ſimple Reader ought not to imagine, that the ſonne of God would not haue come into the world, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed the world, nor endured this torment and thirſt, if it had not been written in the Prophets: for hee muſt learne, that the Scriptures are tied vnto Chriſt, and not Chriſt vnto the Scriptures; becauſe that they ſhould not haue been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, if hee ſhould not haue been borne and crucified; and yet he ſhould haue been borne and crucified, although the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had not ſpoken it. Venerable <hi>Beed</hi> ſayth, Seeing that all Chriſts actions are great, and thoſe of his death and paſsion moſt great, it is much to be noted, and to bewondered at, why it was the pleaſure of the ſonne of God, that his thirſt ſhould be his laſt work, and that he would depart out of this life with great thirſt. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth, The laſt griefe and paine
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:3666:171"/>which Chriſt ſuffered was his thirſt, the laſt complaint which hee made vvas of his thirſt, and the laſt requeſt vvhich hee made vvas for a cup of vvater, and the laſt torment vvhich he endured vvas of the gaule, vineger and mire vvhich hee dranke, becauſe that immediately after that hee had taſted of that cup he gaue vp his ghoſt vnto his Father. Seeing ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that this thirſt is the laſt torment, the laſt requeſt, the laſt complaint, and the laſt vvorke that Chriſt did in this vvorld, it is conuenient that vvee tell vvho hee is vvho ſuffereth this thirſt, vvhere hee dooth ſuffer it, for vvhome hee doth ſuffer it, and at vvhat time he doth ſuffer it. Hee vvho ſuffereth is Chriſt, the place vvhere is vpon the croſſe, I am hee for vvhoſe ſake hee ſuffered it, the time vvas vntill death, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that with the ſame great thirſt vvhich hee endured, his ſoule vvas drawne and pulled out of his body. The high my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the croſſe of Chriſt may vvell bee compared vnto the eating of Pine-apples, and their kernels, the vvhich the oftener they be caſt into the fire and taken out, the more ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels they yeeld to eat, and more huske to burn. That which happeneth vnto the labourer vvith thoſe Pines and kernels, dooth happen vnto vs in theſe diuine myſteries, in the vvhich the more vvee thinke vpon the paſsion and croſſe, the more ſecrets vvee diſcouer, and the more myſteries vvee find. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> ſayth, That vvhich men diſpoſe of a little before their death, is alwaies of greater importance, than that vvhich vve deale vvith in our life time, becauſe it is done vvith grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter heed, prouided for with deeper conſideration, orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vvith better diſcretion, rated and determined vvith better conſcience. No man did euer diſpoſe better of his life and ſoule, than Chriſt did of his owne perſon and the church, becauſe hee diſpoſed of them vvith more care than <hi>Iacob,</hi> vvth more pittie than <hi>Iſaac,</hi> with more diſcretion than <hi>Ioſue,</hi> vvith greater wiſedome than <hi>Dauid,</hi> and greater bounty and liberality than <hi>Salamon. Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier da mihi bibere,</hi> ſaid Chriſt to the Samaritane vvoman, As if hee vvould ſay, Giue mee a cup of vvater, good
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:3666:172"/>woman, becauſe thou ſeeſt that I am weary of the way, and very thirſty. When Chriſt ſaid vnto the woman, <hi>Da mihi bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere,</hi> and alſo when he ſaid vpon the croſſe, I am a thirſt, it was a ſigne that he had been a thirſt many daies, and alſo many yeares, and very deſirous to quench his thirſt with water. That which Chriſt ſayth in the 7 of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſeemeth to bee very contrary vnto this, If any man bee a thirſt, let him come vnto mee. Vpon a ſolemne day of Eaſter, Chriſt cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed publikely in the market place. If any man bee a thirſt let him come vnto mee. O high myſtery and deepe ſecret! who is able to vnderſtand that which Chriſt ſayth in this place, ſeeing that ſometime hee asketh the Samaritane woman for a little water, and on the croſſe hee ſayth that he dieth with thirſt, and yet on the other ſide hee maketh open procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that all vvhich bee thirſty ſhould come vnto him? How can theſe two ſpeeches hang together, Woman giue mee ſome drinke, and this, If any man bee a thirſt, let him come vnto mee? Doeſt thou inuite all men to come to drinke at thy Tauerne, and haſt thou not a cup of water for to quench thy owne thirſt? For the better vnderſtanding of this, it is to bee noted, that God doth take ſome things of vs, and yet there are ſome things which God doth giue vnto vs; which is eaſily perceiued, in that hee tooke fleſh of vs when hee would become man, and yet if wee vvill become pure and holy, hee muſt impart his grace vnto vs. This being ſo, vvhen Chriſt ſayth, If any man bee a thirſt let him come vnto mee, hee doth giue vs to vnderſtand, that hee is the fountaine of grace, of the vvhich vvee ſhould all drinke of: and vvhen hee ſayih, Woman giue mee ſome drinke, he doth let vs alſo vnderſtand, that there are ſome things in vs of the which hee would bee ſerued vvithall. When the ſonne of God ſayth, If any man bee thirſty let him come vnto mee, to vvhat vvater, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt thou, doth he inuite thee, but vnto the water of his grace and of his glory? And when hee ſayth vnto the Samaritane woman, giue me drinke, what water thinkeſt thou did he ask,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:3666:172"/>but onely patience and obedience? Chriſt doth inuite vs to drinke of his great goodneſſe and fauours, and hee craueth of vs of the water of the pooles of our poore ſeruice, ſaying <hi>Da mihi bibere,</hi> in ſo much that to ſhew the great loue which hee doth beare vnto his creatures, hee faineth that hee hath need of their ſeruices. S. <hi>Barnard</hi> vpon thoſe wordes of the Pſalme, <hi>Sitiuit anima mea ad deum fontem viuum</hi> ſayth, O what a great difference there is betwixt the thirſt of the good and the bad, becauſe the bad thirſt after nothing but wickedneſſe, and the good after vertues, the bad after tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall things, and the good after ſpirituall, the one after ſinne, and the other after amendment, ſo that all the thirſt of the wicked is after ſinne, and the thirſt of the good after ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. <hi>Baſil</hi> vpon the Pſalme ſayth, The Prophet vvould neuer haue ſaid, My ſoule hath thirſted after God a liuely ſpring, if hee could haue found the fountayne of glory in this vvorld, and the vvater of grace in this life. But alaſſe of how many vvaters ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer wee drinke of, and how many waters ſoeuer wee ſeeke for, wee ſhall neuer meet with the water of life, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till vvee come to enioy the diuine eſſence. <hi>Hugo de ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto victore</hi> vpon the Pſalme ſayth, All the thinges of this life are drie fountaines, and dead waters; &amp; conrary, all things of glory are freſh fountaines and water of life: for there and not here vvee ſhall liue all contented, and not thirſt at all. All which liue in this vvorld, liue in hunger and thirſt, becauſe all the vices vvhich wee like of doe hurt and not profite, make vs ſorrowfull and not ioifull, vveary and not recreate vs, loath and not fill vs. What vicious man is there in the world, who the more he doth giue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to vice, is not the more thirſty after them? Let not the Deuill deceaue thee, my brother, in ſaying I vvill now cloy and glut my ſelfe vvith vice: for the more thou doeſt eat and drinke and bee merry, although thou doe ſeeme to bee fully ſatisfied, yet thou art not ſo, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a vveary. Saint <hi>Barnard</hi> vpon the Paſsion of our
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:3666:173"/>Lord ſayth, What dooth it meane that the ſonne of God went out of this vvorld dead with thirſt, but onely that there is nothing in this world that can quench the thirſt of our ſoule? <hi>Anſelmus</hi> ſayth, How is it poſsible, O my good Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, how is it poſsible that I ſhould liue in the vvorld conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and fully ſatisfied, ſeeing that thou diddeſt depart out of it hungry and thirſty? S. <hi>Ierome</hi> vpon S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, All that the vvorld doth giue vs to quench our thirſt withall, is but vineger, and all that hee giueth vs to mittigate our hunger is but gaule, the which thinges being vvell prooued doe take away our life, and not our thirſt. <hi>Robertus</hi> vpon Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayth, That for the ſon of God to die vvith thirſt, is to let vs vnderſtand, that haue we neuer ſo many dignities, let vs heap vp neuer ſo much riches, and let vs proue neuer ſo many vices, and let vs cocker our ſelues all we can, yet we ſhal depart with as great thirſt out of this world, as if we had not liued but one moment in it. In this ſorrowful life there is nothing but is thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty: the fleſh doth thirſt after daintie cheriſhing, the ſoule doth thirſt after longer life, the heart dooth thirſt for more ſtrength, the Deuill to deceiue vs, and Chriſt doth thirſt after our ſaluation. Which of all theſe doe not liue in hunger and thirſt? What doth our fleſh but complaine in euery part, that we keepe it naked, that we keepe it hungry, weary, diſconten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and dead with thirſt? What ſinfull ſoule did euer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of this vvretched life, ſo beſet vvith griefe, or loaden vvith yeares, vvhich vvould nor haue giuen all that hee had beene worth to haue liued one yeare longer? What humane heart is there on earth, which wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth not to get more, and breaketh not his ſleep to be worth more? Why dooth the Deuill vvatch but to keepe his own, and beguile the good? Why are there ſo many ſorts of vices in the vvorld, and ſo many entiſements, but to quench the thirſt vvhich it hath, to make vs all vaine, vvordly, and light? Why did the ſonne of God come into the world, preach the Goſpell, liue in paine, and die vpon the croſſe, but onely for the great thirſt
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:3666:173"/>which he had to ſaue the world? Loe then, we haue prooued how the fleſh, the heart, the ſoule, the world, the diuell, and Chriſt, are all hungry and deſire thee O my ſoule: and that which cannot bee ſpoken without teares is, that onely Chriſt doth thirſt after thy ſaluation, and all the other after thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. O my ſoule, if thou haddeſt as great a thirſt to amend thy ſelfe, as Chriſt hath to ſaue thee, or if thou haddeſt as great a thirſt to amend thy ſelfe as theſe thy enemies haue to deceiue thee, I doe promiſe thee that thou wouldeſt not liue as thou doeſt ſo careleſſy, nor yet behaue thy ſelfe ſo rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly. The good doe inherite the thirſt of our bleſſed Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Ieſus Chriſt, and the wicked doe inherite the thirſt of the diuell. And what is the thirſt which the good doe inherite, but to be peacemakers, humble, chaſt, ſober, and very charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? And what is the thirſt which the wicked doe inherite of the deuill, but to bee more mighty, and rich, and more vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? O what great difference there is betwixt theſe two thirſts! for the thirſt of the good and vertuous goeth to bee quenched at the fountaine of life, which is glory; &amp; the thirſt of the wicked goeth to bee quenched at the dead waters of paine and puniſhment; in ſo much that ſuch as our thirſt is in this world, ſuch ſhall bee the water which wee ſhall drinke of in the other. O how wel the Prophet ſaid, My ſoule did thirſt after the liuing God, becauſe that all the water which our Lord doth giue vs to drinke is of the liuely fountaine, which is cleare vnto the eie, and freſh to recreat, ſauerous to prouide of, and wholeſome to taſt of, delicare in diſgeſting, and moſt precious to keepe. The water which the world giueth his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers to drinke of is deep to teach vnto, troubled to ſee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, vnſauery to drinke, puddle in taſt, and ſtinking to keepe. Let vs conclude then that the ſeruant of God is alwaies thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and deſirous of God, who as hee who is very thirſty doth ſeeke drinke with all diligence, ſo he who is deſirous of God doth ſeeke all the waies and meanes he can to ſerue and obey him.</p>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> Reg. 3. chap. 17, as if he would ſay; It is my will and pleaſure, O <hi>Helias,</hi> that thou liue no more in this land, but that thou ſhouldeſt goe out of it, and thou ſhalt goe towards the Eaſt, and hide thy ſelfe in the brook Carith, where thou ſhalt haue no need to fear hunger, becauſe I wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand the crows to bring thee meat and bread euery day, and there thou haſt water inough for thy drinking. When our Lord did command <hi>Helias</hi> to goe out of Samaria, there was a great famine ouer all the land, and he was alſo perſecuted by the wicked queen <hi>Iezabel:</hi> and yet hauing an intention to ſuccour his Prophet, he appointed him a place far off, where he ſhould hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and prouided him all kind of victuals for him to eat. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> being gone to the brooke Carith, there hee lay hidden a long time, feeding only vpon that which the crows gaue him, and drinking of the water which ran in the ſtream. And after a few months were paſt, and the Queens perſecution was cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed, and the famine amended, <hi>Helias</hi> returned to the people, and the crowes were ſeene no more. Before we doe come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to theſe myſteries, it is here to bee noted, what great care our Lord hath ouer his ſeruants, and how he is neuer careleſſe of his friends, becauſe his naturall condition is neuer to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindfull of thoſe which doe not forget to ſerue him. <hi>Cum ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſum, eripiam eum, &amp; glorificabo eum,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt in the name of our Lord: and his meaning is, I my ſelf, and no other,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:3666:174"/>will bee alwaies with him in his troubles, and I will bring him ſafe out of them, and he ſhall eſcape out of them with honor and glory. If wee doe well vnderſtand Chriſt, hee promiſeth three thinges vnto ſuch as ſuffer perſecution and tribulation for his ſeruice: The firſt is, that hee will bee at their ſide in all troubles and vexations: the ſecond, that they ſhall neuer loſe their life, nor endanger their conſcience for any trouble, be it neuer ſo ſtrong: the third, that hee will deliuer them out of that trouble with great fame and glory. If ſuch great profite be gotten by perſecution, why doth any man follow the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and delights of the world? What tribulation is there in this world ſo hard and dangerous, which is not ouercomed with the helpe of Chriſt? O how happy is that ſoule which is tempted for the ſeruice of God, and is perſecuted for the loue of him! ſeeing he hath giuen his word and his credit that he will not ſuffer any to fall in his temptation, nor forſake any man in his tribulation. Note gentle Reader, that Chriſt doth not ſay, I am with them <hi>In gaudio &amp; exultatione,</hi> in mirth and ioy, but <hi>In tribulatione,</hi> in tribulation: for as in this life he knew nothing but how to ſhed tears, ſuffer temptations, endure tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, ſo he hath compaſsion of none but of ſuch as weep, and are perſecuted and tempted; in ſo much that as the diuell is the captaine and ring-leader of all which liue in pompe and iolitie, ſo Chriſt is the head of all that are afflicted and in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation. Saint <hi>Barnard</hi> ſayth, If this that is ſaid, <hi>Cumipſo ſum in tribulatione,</hi> be not performed in thee, thinke with thy ſelf that thou doeſt not ſuffer that tribulation for Chriſt, but for thy friend and thy ſelfe; and therfore in that caſe let him help and ſuccour thee for whome thou doeſt ſuffer that danger. If thou doe not make reckoning of Chriſt, nor thinke on him, nor ſuffer for his ſake, what hath Chriſt to doe with thy paint and trauaile? If thou do ſuffer for the fleſh, let the fleſh help thee, if thou ſuffer for the world, let the world deliuer thee, if thou ſuffer for thy friend, let thy friend giue thee aid, if thou doe ſuffer for Chriſt, to Chriſt commend thy ſelfe: for if thou doe ſerue others, what reaſon is it that thou ſhouldſt ask
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:3666:175"/>fauour of him. Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> ſayth, What friend had God at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time whom hee forgot, or in what tribulation did hee euer ſee him when hee helped him not? <hi>Gregory</hi> in his Regiſter ſayth, Hee who did not forget <hi>Noe</hi> in the floud, nor <hi>Abraham</hi> in Chaldea, nor <hi>Lot</hi> in Sodome, nor <hi>Iſaac</hi> in Paleſtine, nor <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> in Aſſyria, nor <hi>Daniel</hi> in Babilon, doeſt thou think that he will forget thee in thy affliction and tribulation? <hi>Remigius</hi> ſayth, If this promiſe of <hi>Cum ipſo ſum in tribulatione,</hi> bee not kept with thee, thinke that our Lord dooth it, either for thy greater profite, or his owne ſeruice: for the greater the tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is which thou endureſt, the more thou doeſt merite for thy ſoule: and if it be not for this cauſe, it is becauſe thou ſhalt fall into ſome greater danger, from the which our Lord doth keepe his holy hand and diuine ſuccour to deliuer thee. And becauſe that the curious Reader may not thinke that wee ſwarue from our purpoſe, it is to bee noted, that the Prophet <hi>Helius</hi> (whoſe figure we handled) was beſet with three grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous perſecutions, that is, with the warre which was in Iury, with the famine which was ouer all the land, and with <hi>Ieza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi> hatred. He durſt not preach for feare of the Queene, hee durſt not goe abroad for feare of the warre, hee durſt not hide himſelfe for feare of famine and hunger; in ſo much that this holy Prophet was ſo much without hope of remedy, that he knew not whether hee ſhould haue his throat cut openly, or whether he ſhould die for hunger ſecretly. Our Lord there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to fulfill his promiſe, <hi>Cum ipſo ſum in tribulatione,</hi> tooke him out of Iury, vnwitting to the ſouldiors; and did hide him in Carith, where no man could ſee him, and ſent him meat by crowes to feed on, and did prouide him a ſtreame of water to drinke of. Wee may gather by this example what a good Lord wee haue, and what care hee hath ouer vs if wee ſerue him, ſeeing that hee doth pay vs for all wee doe, and ſuccour vs for all that we ſuffer for him. To come now vnto the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, all this figure was fulfilled in Chriſt at the foot of the letter: for as <hi>Heliac</hi> was perſecuted by <hi>Iezabel,</hi> ſo was Chriſt of the Synagogue, and Chriſt found as great a famine of good
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:3666:175"/>men, as <hi>Helias</hi> did in Samaria of victuals. <hi>Hugo de ſancto victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi> ſayth vpon thoſe words of <hi>Ieremy, Paruuli petierunt panem,</hi> The bread which the little ones cried for to ear, and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation which <hi>Ieremy</hi> made becauſe there was no man to giue it him, was not vnderſtood of the materiall bread which was woont to bee in the arke, but of ſpirituall bread, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the ſoules are fed: and to ſay that there was no man found to giue it them, was as much as to ſay, that there was no good man left to preach vnto them. <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> in an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily ſayth, In Commonwealths well gouerned, the want of a good man is greater than the famine of bread and wine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we haue ſeene that God hath ſent a famine for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits of one man alone, and after abundance for one good mans ſake alone. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſayth, Famine, warre, and peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, are much to bee feared in naughty Commonwealths, and where there are no good perſons: for although our Lord doth ſuffer them to come for a time, yet he doth not conſent that they ſhould long time endure. What goodneſſe haue Commonwealths in them, if they haue no good men in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? And what want they, if they doe not want good men? Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his Confeſsions ſayth, When I hear a knill rung for the dead, my ſoule is preſently driuen into a perplexity, whether I ſhould weepe firſt for the good which die, or the bad which liue, becauſe there is as great reaſon that we ſhould weepe for the life of the bad, as for the death of the good. Now that we haue prooued, that the want &amp; famine of good men is more dangerous in a city than a dearth of victuals, who doth doubt but that the ſcarſeneſſe which Chriſt ſound in the Synagogue was greater than that which <hi>Helias</hi> found in Paleſtine? What good thing, or what good man could there be in the Synagogue, where the Viceroy <hi>Pilate</hi> was a Tyrant, the famous high Prieſt <hi>Caiphas</hi> a Symoniacle, &amp; the maiſters the Phariſies Hypocrites, and the counſellours the Sadduces Heretikes, and their kings and Prophets all ended? The ſonne of God did kill this hunger, when hee gaue the world a church for a Synagogue, Apoſtles for Prophets, a
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:3666:176"/>law of loue for a law of feare, a new Teſtament for an old, the ſpirit for the letter, the truth for the figure, and his holy grace for our old offence. What would haue become of vs, if Chriſt had not left ſo many good men in his church? Hee left vs many Martyrs, many confeſſours, many vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, many doctors; in ſo much that when Chriſt died, although hee left not the vvorld many bookes to read in, yet hee left vs many Saints to follow. The figure ſayth further, that <hi>Helias</hi> went to hide himſelfe in the water-brooke of Carith, which was a figure, that the ſonne of God ſhould come to take fleſh, and hide himſelfe in the entralls of the Virgines wombe: and as it was figured in <hi>Helias,</hi> ſo it was accompliſhed in Chriſt, becauſe that vnder his humanity vvhich hee tooke vpon him, hee did hide his diuinity which hee carried with him. When the Prophet <hi>Eſayas</hi> ſaid, <hi>Verè tues deus abſconditus,</hi> hee knew well that God would hide himſelfe for a time, and remoue himſelfe from their eies, ſeeing that the catholicke Church did acknowledge him, and the vnhappy Synagogue was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull vnto him. <hi>Recede hinc &amp; abſconde te in torrentem Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rith:</hi> the eternall Father ſpake theſe words vnto his precious ſonne, as if hee had ſaid vnto him, Goe my ſonne, goe and hide thy ſelfe in the world, becauſe thou maiſt redeeme the world: Where thou ſhalt hide thy power becauſe thou maiſt ſuffer, thou ſhalt hide thy wiſedome, becauſe they may mock thee, thou ſhalt hide thy prudence, becauſe they may take thee to bee vnwiſe, thou ſhalt hide thy iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, becauſe they are to iudge thee like a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and thou ſhalt hide thy ſtrength, becauſe thou maiſt the better die. O how well this was fulfilled in Chriſt, hide thy ſelfe in the water-brooke of Carith! for if he ſhould not haue hidden his great power before <hi>Pilate,</hi> who would haue been able to take his life from him? If the ſon of God ſhould not haue hidden his eternal wiſedome, durſt the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies haue mocked at his doctrine as they did? If Chriſt ſhould not haue hidden the rigour of his iuſtice, who would
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:3666:176"/>haue beene able to doe iuſtice vpon him? If Chriſt ſhould not haue hidden his inexpugnable ſtrength, how ſhould it haue beene poſsible for any man to draw his life out of his body? The Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> ſpake vnto this purpoſe, <hi>Ibi ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcondita est potentia eius,</hi> As if hee would haue ſaid: Thou maiſt not looke, O Synagogue, thou maiſt not looke for a Meſsias which will bee mighty but weake, not rich but poor, not in health but ſicke: do not imagine that he ſhould be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable but throwne downe; doe not proclaime him for to bee a great Lord but a ſeruant; hee ſhall not bee a warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, but a man of peace; and hee ſhall not goe much openly, but for the moſt part in hucker mucker. Seeing that <hi>Eſaias</hi> ſayth, thou art truly a hidden God, and alſo <hi>Zacharias</hi> that his power is hidden, why dooth the Synagogue looke that the Meſsias ſhould come openly, conſidering that their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſaid that hee was to come ſecretly? <hi>Origen</hi> in his Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archon ſayth, Becauſe the ſonne of God came not to fight with viſible men, but with inuiſible ſinnes and enemies, there was no neceſsity that he ſhould come fighting, but preaching, it was not needful that hee ſhould wander ouer all the world, but only publiſh his Goſpell among them all, and if the arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Iewes did not reach vnto the knowledge thereof, it was not becauſe they could not, but becauſe they would not. <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophilus</hi> ſayth: ſpeaking with the church the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſayth, <hi>Deus noſter manifeſte veniet;</hi> and ſpeaking vvith the Synagogue, the Propht <hi>Eſay</hi> ſayth, <hi>Vere tu es deus abſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus,</hi> and therevpon it happeneth, that the vnhappie Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, although they were learned in knowledge, yet of no credite in conſcience, and ſo they deſerued not to know him, becauſe they vvould not beleeue him. The figure goeth further and ſayth, that the place where <hi>Helias</hi> went to hide himſelfe, vvas at water-brookes of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rith, which is as much to ſay as, a thing cut in ſunder, or parted in the middle, which had bin once whole. The water-brooke where Chriſt did hide himſelfe, was the depth and vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of his paſsion, where our good Lord entered diuing and
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:3666:177"/>ducking as in a dirty and dangerous riuer, where hee remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned drowned and dead in the water of his paſsion: and the ſonne of God p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ted himſelfe in two, when his ſoule went into hell, and his body remained in the graue, and when thoſe parts which made him a man were diſſolued, although they were neuer ſeuered from the Hypoſtaticall vnion, ſeeing that he was aſwell God in hell and in the graue, as hee is this day in heauen. He was ſo hidden in the brooke of his paſsion, that there was no part of his diuinity ſeene, and the beauty of his humanity ſcarſely perceiued: and becauſe our bleſſed Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer would ſuffer his enemies to be reuenged on him, hee did ſuſpend for that time, the operation of thoſe miracles which might haue hindered his paſsion. The figure ſayth further, that the Prophet <hi>Helias</hi> being in the brooke ſecret and cloſe, crowes of the fields brought him his dinner in the forenoon, and his ſupper at night, ſo that the birds gaue him to eat, and the water to drink. If this myſtery were not a figure and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling of ſome other great myſtery, it were to bee thought, that as God did ſend the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> meat by <hi>Abachuch</hi> the Prophet, ſo hee would haue ſent <hi>Helias</hi> meat by ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prophet, or holy man. If by <hi>Helias</hi> Chriſt be figured, by <hi>Iezabel</hi> the Synagogue, by the perſecution his paſsion, and by the brooke the croſſe, and by the water his bloud, and by his hiding himſelfe his death, why ſhould not the crowes ſignifie the Iews? Seeing there were Eagles inowe in the aire, and Pigeons plenty in the world, what great ability did God ſee in the crow, that he ſhould make him ſteward vnto <hi>Helias</hi> his faithfull friend? What was the meaning that God did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit <hi>Helias</hi> to the crowes, but that hee ſhould alſo commit his ſonne into the hands of the Iewes? The qualities of a Crow are, to bee in colour blacke, in flying flow, in his fleſh hard, in ſmelling quicke, in eating rauenous, and in condition vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. And becauſe the rauen or crow is an vngratefull bird, the Prouerbe is, that if thou bring vp a Crow, hee will pecke out thy eie. The people of the Iewes were an vngratefull Crow vnto Chriſt, ſeeing that for a recompence that he tooke fleſh
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:3666:177"/>of them, and taught them ſo long time, although they did not pecke out his eies, yet they crucified all his members on the croſſe. What bad thing is there in the crow, that is not alſo in the Iewes? They are blacke in faith, ſlow in iudgement, hard in beliefe, cruell in condition, ready to malice, and moſt couetous. What meaneth this, O my Father, what meaneth this? After that thy ſonne had liued thirty three whole years, doeſt thou command him to be caſt vnto Crowes? Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Crowes which we ſee with our eies, are not ſo cruell as the Iewes which wee ſpeake off, becauſe the Crowes doe eat of nothing vntill it be dead, but the wicked Iewes did venter vpon Chriſt when hee was yet aliue. O that <hi>Helias</hi> did farre better with his Crowes, than the good Ieſus with the Iewes, becauſe <hi>Helias</hi> Crowes did giue him bread and fleſh to eat, but Chriſts crowes gaue him nothing but vineger and gaule to taſt. Let the concluſion of all our ſpeech be, that it was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with <hi>Helias</hi> in his baniſhment and water-brooke, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with Chriſt on the Mount of Caluary, becauſe <hi>Helias</hi> went out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue from the water, and Chriſt remained dead on the Mount of Caluary, and <hi>Helias</hi> did neuer know what hunger was, but the ſonne of God did neuer kill his hunger, nor quench his thirſt.</p>

<pb n="350" facs="tcp:3666:178"/>that within the Temple, and hard at the altar they dranke the wine which was prepared for the condemned, and they lay downe and leaned vpon the garments which were laid to pledge. It is an vſuall thing and common in tauerns, that drunkards doe caſt themſelues downe to ſleepe vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens apparrell, and if it bee in hote Summer, to ſleepe vpon the benches of the Temple. If there were no greater matter contained vnder this complaint and rebuke, and if the ſence were not of greater weight than the letter, and the thing figured worthier than the figure, it was no new thing, nor rare fault, to drinke of another mans wine, or caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vpon ſome cloke laid to pledge, or to ſleepe in the holy Temple. That which God ſpeaketh here, and that which our Lord complaineth of, reacheth further than it ſeemeth for, and dooth draw vs vnto a deeper myſtery than outwardly it appeareth: for if we marke it well, God did neuer ſpeake vnto the Synagogue, but it did redound afterward to ſome myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the church. Firſt the Prophet in this place maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of certain garments: ſecondly, that thoſe garments were a pawne and pledge: thirdly, that they were laid neere vnto an altar: fourthly, that drunkards lay vpon them: fiftly, that they dranke there much wine: ſixtly, that that wine was the wine of condemned perſons: and then that they dranke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the holy Temple. What one of theſe words dooth want his myſtery, or what circumſtance is there not worthy of deepe conſideration? In the ſelfeſame ſort that this was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecied by <hi>Oſee,</hi> it was fulfilled by Chriſt: for wine being brought for Chriſt to drinke of, and alſo the other theeues, the Iewes did not onely not giue it them, but did themſelues drinke it, &amp; then being very dronk, they took Chriſts clothes, and caſt them on the ground, and ſate vpon them. When the Prophet ſayth, that they dranke the wine, &amp; lay down vpon the garments hard by the altar, hee ſayth moſt truly: for the firſt church that euer was in the world was the Mount of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uary, the firſt altar was the croſſe, the firſt ſacrifice offered vp for the redemption of man, was his own body to be crucified
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:3666:178"/>on good Friday, vpon the ſame altar of the croſſe the firſt faithfull were the Virgine and Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> with the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and ſecret diſciples. In that holy Temple, and by that ſacred altar, who were they which leaned &amp; were caſt down vpon the garments, but onely the vnhappy and vnfortunate Iewes? Thinke it is a great myſtery, that the Prophet did not ſee thoſe of his Synagogue ſitting, but leaning neere vnto the altar, to let vs vnderſtand, that they be neither open Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, nor conceiled Iewes: for Chriſtians they could not bee, becauſe they will not beleeue in Chriſt; and if they will bee Iewes they haue no Temple where to Iudaize. <hi>Robertus</hi> ſayth, Vntill this day the Iewes are not proſtrate before the altar, which is Chriſt, to beleeue him, nor yet on their knees to worſhip him, nor on foot to defend him, nor embracing him in ſigne of loue, but leaning to offend him, becauſe their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is to tread his holy garments vnder feet, and keepe off Ieſus Chriſt from them with their elbowes. Taking this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie in another ſence, it is to bee noted, that oftentimes in Scripture by good garments are vnderſtood good works, and by torne garments naughty workes; and therevpon it is, that as the body is clad and foſtered with a new garment, ſo the ſoule is decked and garniſhed with holy workes. And becauſe that the curious Reader may not thinke that we ſpeak at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, we will proue our ſaying by Scripture. What was the meaning that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw Chriſt <hi>Veſtitum ponere,</hi> which was to ſee him with a long garment, but to ſee him loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with vertues from the head to the foot? Hee that went to the wedding not hauing his nuptiall garment, but becauſe hee was vncomely clothed, was carried to priſon: who is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented vnto vs, but hee, who although he doe lead an euill life, yet dooth dare to enioy Chriſtian liberty? When God doth command in the Apocalips, <hi>Omni tempore veſtimenta tua ſint candida,</hi> let thy garments be white alwaies, what doth he ſignifie, but that we ſhould be all cleane and vertuous? When the Scripture ſaith, that <hi>Iacob</hi> made his ſonne <hi>Ioſeph, Tunicam polymitam,</hi> that is, an embrodered garment downe to the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:3666:179"/>ground. What was the meaning that his garment did reach ſo low, but that the ſonne of God ſhould be perfite in all ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues? What did it ſignifie that the Iewes did caſt clothes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the aſſe feet to goe ouer, and the Apoſtle put them vpon the aſſe which Chriſt rode vpon, but that he miſliked all that the Synagogue did, and approoued all that the church did? S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth, Becauſe in holy writ, by the garments which wee weare are vnderſtood the works which wee doe, wee may truly ſay, that no man goeth well clothed but the vertuous man, nor no man with a torne coat but the wicked and naughty ſinner. Chriſt did vſe but two garments in this world, the one next his skin, which was without ſeame, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an vpper garment which ſerued him for a cloke &amp; coat; in ſo much that Chriſt did ſhew the perfection of his pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty not only in his diet, but alſo in the ſimpleneſſe of his appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell. <hi>Barnard</hi> ſayth, The ſonne of God did teach vs not onely to liue, but alſo to apparell ourſelues, becauſe his holy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were few in number, vild in colour, ſmall of price, good in profite, but cleane in vſe. <hi>Hylarius</hi> ſayth, Although the garments which the ſonne of God ware were but few, vild &amp; torne, yet the Scripture dooth much eſteeme of them, not for the value vvhich they are vvorth, but for the great myſteries which they did ſignifie. <hi>Origen</hi> in an Homily ſayth, What vvere the garments vvhich the ſonne of God vvent alwaies clad vvith, but his diuine and humane nature, wherof he was made? His coat without ſeame, and in which there neuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred needle nor ſciſſers, was his diuine nature in great purity glorious from the beginning, in the which there was no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, nor ſhall bee no end; for that nature is now as it was from the beginning, and ſhall be for euer as it is at this inſtant. By the other coat vvhich vvas ſowne and cur, is vnderſtood Chriſts ſacred humanity, vvhich vvas formed by the Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghoſt, and borne of the Virgine <hi>Mary,</hi> and therefore Chriſts vvearing of theſe two coats doth ſignifie, that hee and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is God and man, and the ſonne vvhich vvas incarnate. Before that Chriſt tooke fleſh, hee had but one coat to couer
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:3666:179"/>ſelfe withall, which was his diuinity: but after that hee came into the vvorld, he put on another coat, vvhich vvas his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and by that means he did lend vs his coat to make vs holy, and vvee did lend him ours to make him a man. Saint <hi>Chriſostome</hi> ſayth, The one of Chriſts coats, to wit, that vvhich vvas vvithout ſeame, continued vvhole and vntorne in his paſsion, but his vppermoſt garment vvas rent and torne, to giue vs to vnderſtand, that although his enemies had power to lay hands vpon his ſacred humanity, yet they had none at all to touch his diuinity. <hi>Damaſcen</hi> ſayth, One of Chriſts coats fell vvhole and entire vnto the knights, and the other torne and ragged vnto the hangmen, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe vvee ſhould vnderſtand, that to the catholicke church there fell the entire and whole coat, ſeeing that ſhee dooth fully beleeue that Chriſt is both God and man, and vnto the Synagogue there happened his torn coat, ſeeing they beleeue that hee is no more than a bare man. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth, By Chriſts two garments are vnderſtood both his bodies, that is, his true body made and compacted of his holy mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and his myſticall body, which are all good Chriſtians: and becauſe thou maieſt perceaue, my brother, how much thou art bound vnto Chriſt, know thou, that hee did eſteeme better of his myſticall body, vvhich are Chriſtians, than of his owne true body which vvas made of his owne mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. What vvas his meaning that hee ſuffered them to take away and teare in pieces the one of his coats, and yet neuer touch the other, but only that hee is more grieued when any man doth ſpeake euill of his church, than to haue laid hands vpon his owne proper perſon? <hi>Remigius</hi> ſayth, O how whole, and entire hee did leaue vs the vnſowne coat of his church! and yet naughty Chriſtians and perfideous Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes, doe rent his coat into as many pieces, as they doe raiſe diſſentions, and ſtirre vp hereſies in the church. It was Chriſts holy vvill to die not only without a coat, but alſo not to haue one thred of a coat vpon him, which hee did ſuffer to the
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:3666:180"/>great preiudice of his grauity, and loſſe of his credite. Who was euer, or vvho euer ſhall bee ſo graue in his doctrine, as the ſonne of God vvas, and ſo honeſt in his perſon? And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Eſayas</hi> ſayth, that hee was offered vp becauſe hee would, it is to bee beleeued, that ſeeing they could not cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie him, if he himſelfe vvould not, ſo they could neither haue ſtripped him naked vnleſſe he had conſented vnto it. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it followeth in a good conſequence, that if hee would die for our redemption, that hee did let himſelfe bee ſtripped for our comfort. What did it ſignifie that the ſonne of God did put off all his garments, but that hee did diſpoſſeſſe himſelfe of all his good workes? I and thou, thou and I, my brother, haue great need to die clothed and clad, to wit, vvith our owne faith and good vvorks, and alſo bee helped by others. For as for holy Ieſus, as hee came out of the vvombe of his mother vnited vnto the diuine eſſence, ſo hee had no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of his owne vvorkes, to ſaue himſelfe, nor of other mens merits to pardon vs. <hi>Cyrillus</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayth, Of as much as the ſonne of God did merite praying on the mountaine, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching among the people, healing the diſeaſed in hoſpitals, by ſuffering among his enemies, and dying vpon the croſſe, I ſay hee did ſpoile and make himſelfe naked of all that, and put it vpon vs; inſomuch that wee are heires of his bloud with which he redeemed vs, and ſucceſſors of all the merits which hee heaped together. O glorious inheritance, and happie wealth, which thou good Ieſus diddeſt leaue to the pariſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of thy church! ſeeing that by the meanes thereof, vvee are made ſonnes of the Father, brothers of the ſonne, puples of the Holy ghoſt, companions to the Angels, pariſhioners of the church, and heires of thy glory. O vvhat great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is betwixt the inheritance of heauen, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance in the world! Worldlings leaue their children ſtore of goods and reuenues, and much debate and ſtrife to defend them, and many enemies to perſecute them: but our good Lord in lieue of great wealth did leaue vs his grace, and in
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:3666:180"/>ſteed of enemies did leaue vs his merites. What ſhould haue become of all the ſinners of the world, if as Chriſt died ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and depriued of his goods, ſo hee would haue died clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed vvith all his merits? What ſhould become vnto prowd men, if hee would not haue left them his humilitie, and vvhat of cruell men if hee would not haue left them his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie? What end ſhould angry men come to, if he ſhould not haue left them his patience, and vvhat vvere it of all ſinners, if hee ſhould not haue left them his clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſayth, If Chriſt would haue aſcended to heauen vvith all that which hee merited in this world, and not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part it among vs, and as it were vnclothed himſelfe of them as of certaine garments, there ſhould not haue been in the world at this day a church to preach in, nor Prieſt to bee ordained, nor Sacrament to bee adminiſtred. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillus</hi> ſayth to this purpoſe, If the ſonne of God would haue merited for himſelfe alone, and died for himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, wee might haue ſaid with reaſon, that hee had come into the vvorld, and tooke fleſh vpon him for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and not for vs. But let ſuch blaſphemy bee farre from our tongues and thoughts, and farre from our heart, becauſe our good Lord died not for himſelfe, but for vs, nor did not merite for himſelfe, but for vs. <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go de ſancto victore</hi> ſayth, Becauſe that the great Redeemer of the world did leaue vs his garments for reliques, and his merites for Treaſures, the Church his ſpouſe hath at this day, Sacraments to giue, ſacrifices of a contrite heart to offer, ſweet doctrine to preach, and rewards to promiſe for amendment of life.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>Artiti ſunt vestimenta mea, &amp; ſuper ea miſerunt ſirtem,</hi> ſaid Chriſt in the 21 Pſalme, complaining vnto his Father on the croſſe, as if hee would ſay, O my good Father, thou waſt not content only, that they ſhould ſpoile me of my garments, and turne me naked to my great ſhame, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that the hangmen ſhould deuide my coat, and the ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours caſt lots vpon him. We muſt ſee in this place, how many coats there were, and whoſe they were, and among whome they were deuided, becauſe all our ſaluation dooth conſiſt in being excluded or admitted vnto that deuiſion. There were but two garments in all, and Chriſt was the maiſter of them, and they were deuided betwixt hangmen and ſouldiours, the place where was by the croſſe, and the manner how was by lots. Theſe two garments were deuided betwixt the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men which kept and guarded Chriſt, and the hangme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which crucified Chriſt, inſomuch that according vnto the merite or demerite of euery one of them, they receiued their part of the garment. <hi>Theophilus</hi> ſaith, Who are meant by theſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and knights, but the vertuous and iuſt; and who by the hangmen but ſinners and naughty men? O infinit good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, O clemency neuer ſeene before! ſuch as thine was O good Ieſus vpon the altar of the croſſe, where thou diddeſt barre no man of the inheritance of thy ſweatings, and deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of thy merits, depriue no man, exclude no man, nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherite no man, but there fell aſwel one part to the hangmen which lifted thee vp vpon the croſſe, as to <hi>Nichodemus</hi> who
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:3666:181"/>tooke thee down from the ſame. <hi>Iſichius</hi> vpon <hi>Leuiticus</hi> ſaith, As the ſonne of God was the Redeemer of all men, ſo his pleaſure was, that his garments ſhould be deuided for all, and that none ſhould be excluded from the generall redemption; which he did preſently himſelfe declare, ſeeing that he ſaued the theefe who was a Iew, and conuerted the Centurion who was a Gentile. O what great hope wee haue to be ſaued, and what great confidence that Chriſt will pardon vs! for ſeeing that hee hath diſtributed part of his merites and garments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong butcherly hangmen, it is to be beleeued, that hee will giue with a better will vnto his choſen friends. The difference in deuiding his garments was this, that thoſe cruell hangmen did immediately deuide and teare in pieces his garment as it was giuen them, and the Gentlemen kept it whole as it fell vnto them, in ſo much that in the handling of the garments, the perſons qualities might eaſily haue been knowne. That which the Iewes did in thoſe daies, the ſelfe ſame doe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians at this day: for thoſe which are good doe keepe all that Chriſt commanded them, and thoſe which are wicked, keep no more than pleaſe them: inſomuch that the good and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Chriſtian doth keepe Chriſts garment entire &amp; whole, by endeuouring himſelfe to keepe the commandements; and the wicked and peruerſe doe keepe it rent and torne, and be content with the bare name of Chriſtians. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ſayth, If thou do ſee thy ſelf, my brother, prowd in preſumption, enui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in ambition, angry in impaciency, a glutton in eating, &amp; co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous in giuing, tell me I pray thee, what doeſt thou hold of a Chriſtian, and what doeſt thou want of a Pagan? What greater diſaſter and loſſe could happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto thy ſoule, or what like euill fall vpon thy body, than of all the diſtribution and deuiding of Chriſts coats and merites, there ſhould fall no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to thy lot but the name of a Chriſtian? Doeſt thou not know that they call thee a Chriſtian in a mockery, if thou do not follow Chriſt, as they call him white <hi>Iohn,</hi> who is all blacke? O how vnhappy they be, vnto whome there fell no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a ſhred of Chriſts garment, that is, to brag that hee
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:3666:182"/>hath heard the Goſpell preached, and that hee was baptiſed like a Chriſtian. For Chriſt is not content only with that, but his pleaſure is, that as he gaue vs all his garments freely, ſo he will that wee ſerue him with all our might and forces. With the hangmen there fell a ſhred of Chriſts garment vnto him who keepeth but one commandement onely, and vnto him his whole coat which keepeth all that Chriſt commandeth: for Chriſt ſaid not vnto the young man, who asked him what he ſhould doe to goe to heauen, Keep the commandement, but keep, &amp; obſerue the commandements. There fell a ſhred or ragge of Chriſts garment vnto him, who thinketh to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the Goſpell onely by wiſhing well; and vnto him it fell whole and entire, who ſerueth him with workes and deeds, and not with deſires: for as Saint <hi>Barnard</hi> ſayth, The heauens are repleniſhed with good workes, and hell is full of good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth, As of children which doe equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herite their fathers goods, ſome doe encreaſe their portion, &amp; ſome waſt and conſume it; ſo is it in the church of God: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all were inheritours of the garments &amp; merits of the ſon of God, yet ſome doe diſsipate and tear them to their own perdition, and ſome conſerue and keep them to their ſaluation. The authority alledged before ſayth, <hi>Super veſtimentis pigno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratis accubuerunt,</hi> as if hee would ſay, The Gentiles ſat down vpon the garments which were laid togage, and the Iews lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned alſo vpon them. For the Prophet to lay downe as a great fault and offence, that the Synagogue durſt bee ſo bold as to leane vpon certaine garments which were laid to pawne, it muſt be expounded with great diligence, and read with great heed, becauſe that in Scripture the newer and more vnuſuall a tearme is, the greater myſtery it doth contain. It is requiſite for vs to declare what theſe garments are, and why they were laid to pawne, and when they were laid to pawn, and alſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whome, becauſe that all theſe circumſtances doe greatly beautifie the myſtery, and lead vs to the ſecret. For the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vnderſtanding of this new propheſie, <hi>Super veſtimentis pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noratis, &amp;c,</hi> Wee muſt handle another place which is as new
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:3666:182"/>as this, the newneſſe whereof vvil bring vs to the knowledge of the other. The new ſpeech is this, <hi>Ecce noua facio omnia;</hi> Which vvords Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in the Apocalips heard Chriſt ſpeak. Behold &amp; mark vvel all you vvhich be of my Church, how I doe not that which others haue done, nor vndertake that vvhich others haue vndertaken, nor teach that vvhich others haue taught, nor liue as others haue liued, becauſe that in my life and family there is no corrupt &amp; rotten thing, but all ſound and whole, nor any old thing but all new. This is ſuch a new kind of ſpeech, that no man euer ſpake the like vntill the ſonne of God came: and to ſay the truth, vnleſſe it vvere he who had created all things, who was able to renue all things? For if all the Angels, and all men are not able to make a flie, how ſhould they be able to make a new vvorld? <hi>Rupertus</hi> ſayth, O how well Chriſt ſayth, in ſaying, Behold I make all new! for beginning in himſelfe, he was a new man, he had a new ſoule, tooke new fleſh, gaue new light, taught new doctrine, liued a new life, and promiſed new glory. Was hee not a new man, ſeeing that no man but hee was both God and man? Who but hee had a new ſoule, ſeeing that his and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vvas vnited to the diuine perſon? took he not new fleſh, ſeeing that none but he vvas of a mother and a virgine? Who but he gaue the vvorld a new law, ſeeing that he vvas the firſt vvhich preached the Goſpell? did he not alſo promiſe a new reward vnto his elect, ſeeing none before him promiſed the kingdome of heauen? <hi>Si volueritis &amp; audieritis me, bona terrae commedetis,</hi> ſaid God. <hi>Eſay</hi> 1. as if hee ſhould ſay, If you vvill beleeue me, &amp; keep my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements, I vvill giue you vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory againſt your enemies, I vvill giue you health to your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, I vvill giue you corne in your fields, and I vvill giue you peace in your kingdomes. This is that the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that God promiſed them, &amp; all the reward vvhich he gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for their trauails, inſomuch that the reward and glory of the Synagogue neuer vvent out of the kingdome of Paleſtine.

Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> ſaith in a Sermon, As the ſonne of God did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand vs to keepe new precepts, ſo he did promiſe vs new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards for it, and as hee gaue great commandements, ſo hee gaue great rewards: wherevpon it is, that vntil hee came into the world, no man commanded that which hee commanded, nor no man promiſed that which he promiſed. Chriſt ſaid not in vaine, <hi>Ecce noua facio omnia,</hi> but becauſe hee inſtituted the Sacrament, which was a hard thing to reach vnto, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded vs to beleeue the bleſſed Trinity, which is a high matter to vnderſtand, willed vs to beleeue him both God &amp; man, which is a new thing to bee receiued, charged vs to loue our enemies, which is a hard matter to doe, and commanded vs to keepe his law only, which was a new thing in the world to doe. S. <hi>Thomas</hi> in his book againſt the Gentiles ſayth, That as the ſonne of God did not command thoſe of the old law to beleeue great things, ſo he did not promiſe them but ſmall things, and becauſe hee commanded his choſen Chriſtians to beleeue hard things, and performe things which were not eaſily done, he promiſed that they ſhould poſſeſſe and emoy very high rewards. To come then vnto the text of <hi>Veſtimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis pignoratis, &amp;c.</hi> It is to bee noted, that as the ſeruice of the iuſt was to bee done here vpon earth, and the reward which they are to receiue to be giuen aboue in heauen; becauſe wee ſhould not thinke that hee mocked vs, in deferring our pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the other world, his pleaſure was to leaue vs a good gage and pledge in this world, vntill he ſhould reward vs for our good life in heauen. The pledges which Chriſt left vs in this world were his precious garments, his holy works, and his moſt holy Sacraments. Why did Chriſt, thinkeſt thou, leaue vs ſo many pledges in this life, but becauſe hee will vnpawne them afterward aboue in his glory? In his glory aboue all
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:3666:183"/>thoſe pledges ſhall bee taken away and haue an end, becauſe that in heauen we ſhall need to hope for nothing, becauſe we ſhall ſee that with our eies, which now we deſire; nor we ſhall haue nothing to beleeue, becauſe there ſhall be nothing hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; wee ſhall haue no cauſe to feare, becauſe there ſhall bee no death; wee ſhall need to aske for nothing, becauſe life is there euerlaſting; neither ſhal we deſire any thing, ſeeing that glory is there perpetuall. O how happie be all Chriſtian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſeeing they haue not only Chriſts garments for a pledge and hoſtage, but alſo Chriſt himſelfe remaining with vs, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the viſible ſigns of the Sacrament, vntil he giue himſelfe vnto vs in heauen glorified! Let no man maruell to heare vs ſay, that we haue Chriſt for a pledge &amp; pawne, for that which his Father promiſed vs, ſeeing that the Apoſtle ſaith alſo that we haue the Holy ghoſt for a pledge, for that which the ſon commanded vs, <hi>Ipſe est pignus haereditatis meae,</hi> as if he would ſay, God the eternal Father hath giuen vs the gifts of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, and all the garments and merites of his ſonne for a pledge of that which hee hath promiſed vs; and this no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger but vntill hee will carry vs to his eternall glory, and giue vs the fruition of his diuine eſſence. What Chriſtian is there who will bee afraid to looſe himſelfe, and not haue a hope to ſaue himſelfe, hauing as wee haue for an aſſurance of our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, as Chriſts robes in pawne, and the gifts of the Holy ghoſt in hoſtage? <hi>Super veſtimentis pignoratis</hi> all holymen doe leane, when they ioine their workes with Chriſts workes: for all that we doe is little worth vnleſſe we tie it vnto Chriſts merits. It is to be weighed, that the Prophet <hi>Oſee</hi> did not ſee the garments by themſelues, and elbowes by themſelues, but garments with elbowes, and elbowes with garments, to giue vs to vnderſtand, that we cannot merite with our own works, and that Chriſt wil not alwaies ſaue vs by himſelfe; by reaſon whereof, it is neceſſary, that wee faſten our armes vpon his workes, and that he ſticke his workes vpon our elbows armes.</p>

The Angell <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael</hi> ſpake theſe words vnto young <hi>Tobias,</hi> as if hee would ſay; Crie not, nor bee not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of this fiſh, but take him out of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, flay him, cut him in the middle, and take out his heart, his gaule, and liuer, and keepe it all for thy ſelfe, becauſe it is all very medicinable to cure a ſicke man. The ſtory of <hi>Tobias</hi> is very well knowne to the learned in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. When he ſent his young ſonne <hi>Tobias</hi> to Rages a towne of the Medes, for the recouering of tenne markes of ſiluer which he had lent his friend <hi>Gabelus,</hi> when hee was captiue in Babilon, and when yong <hi>Tobias</hi> came to the riuer Tygris, to waſh his feet, there came foorth a very great fiſh to the banck ſide toward him, with ſuch boldneſſe, as if hee would haue eaten and ſwallowed him vp, before that hee could flie from him. When the Angell ſaw the fierceneſſe of this fiſh, and the great feare that the youth was ſtroke into, hee began to encourage him, ſaying: Feare not the fiſh, becauſe the fiſh ought rather to be afraid of thee, and therefore it is neceſſary that thou do by him that which he would haue done to thee, becauſe another cannot recouer health before this fiſh bee killed. <hi>Tobias</hi> tooke heart by the encouragement of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, and faſtening on the fiſh by the gilles, drew him out of the water, and ſtripped him, and tooke out his heart, and his gaule, and his liuer, as the Angell his maſter had commanded him to doe. Now that <hi>Tobias</hi> fear was paſt, when the fiſh was dead and drawne, he ſaid vnto his Angell: Tell mee brother <hi>Azarias,</hi> to what purpoſe thou diddeſt command mee to
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:3666:184"/>keepe the fiſhes heart, gaule, and liuer, and diddeſt not bid me eat at all of him. To this the Angell anſwered, Thou muſt vnderſtand, my ſonne <hi>Tobias,</hi> that this thy iourney, and this chance which hath befaln vnto thee, wanteth not a great myſtery, as hereafter it ſhall appeare. But for the preſent, let it ſuffice thee to know, that the meat of this fiſh is good for trauailers to eat of, and the heart good to caſt out diuels, and the gaule good to heale the blind, and the liuer ſoueraine for to cure other externall diſeaſes. There are preſented vnto vs many deepe myſteries in this figure, if it may pleaſe God to giue mee the knowledge to expound them; for in it is ſet foorth the wonderfull death which the ſonne of God ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the inſpeakeable fruit and benefite vvhich vvee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue by it. Here is to bee vnderſtood, who <hi>Tobias</hi> is vvhich taketh the iourney, what the fiſh is which put him into a fright, what garbiſh he tooke from him, what skin he ſtripped him of, what is the fleſh which hee broiled, what is the heart which hee tooke out of him, what the liuer, and vvhat the gaule which hee kept. Although wee ſpeake but a word on euery word, yet this ſeemeth to bee a figure full of great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets. To come then to the point, who is <hi>Tobias</hi> who goeth to recouer his fathers goods, but onely all mankind, who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth euery day a iourney, to recouer the grace which his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Adam</hi> loſt? <hi>Dum ſumus in ſeculo, peregrinamur ad domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> ſayth the Apoſtle, As long as vvee liue in this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall vvorld, no man can ſay that hee hath a dwelling place, or neighbour, but onely, that hee is a pilgrime and a way-faring man, and the end of our iourney and pilgrimage is, to ſeeke for the grace vvhich our firſt father loſt vs, and the glory which our eternall father promiſed vs. Then wee ſay a man is a pilgrime when he maketh no abode any where, but goeth on, and ſtaieth no longer in a place than hee can get neceſſaries for his iourney. If vvee aske a man what hee doth, it is an ordinary anſwere to ſay, that hee either plaieth, or doth his buſineſſe, or ſome ſuch like, which in truth is not ſo, but his better anſwere is to ſay, that he waſteth
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:3666:185"/>and conſumeth himſelfe, and that he is a dying; for a mans life goeth away in playing and labouring. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſayth, Doth not thy life, thinkeſt thou, goe away, ſeeing that euery houre thy life is an houre ſhorter, and euery day a day ſhorter? Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> vpon the Apoſtles words ſayth, If a man be asked how old he is, or what yeares hee hath, he is wont to anſwere either thirty, or fortie, or ſuch like; which is cleane contrary vnto that which hee ſhould anſwere: for hee ſhould not ſay he hath ſo many yeares, but that he wanteth ſo many yeares: for if he haue any years at all, it bee thoſe which hee looketh for; for as for thoſe which are paſt, they are now none of his. The Philoſopher ſaith, that <hi>De tempore non habemus niſi Nunc,</hi> Whereby hee meaneth, that wee haue no time but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent moment, becauſe that the time paſt is already gone, and the time to come is vncertain. <hi>Cicero de ſenectute</hi> ſayth, What hath a man that hath liued an hundred yeares, but only time loſt, a grieued heart, a weary body, ſmal help, a loathing life, a vading credite, and death at his gates? O how well the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſayth, As long as wee bee in this world, <hi>Peregrinamur ad dominum,</hi> ſeeing that by how much the more wee increaſe in age, ſo much the more vvee decreaſe in life. And to ſay the truth, to die young, or to die old, is nothing elſe but to come to our Inne betimes or late. <hi>Remigius</hi> ſayth, The Apoſtle doth call vs pilgrimes and ſtrangers with great reaſon, becauſe he ſeeth, that we haue no goods in this world, which are proper to our ſelues: for if euery man would leaue that which were another bodies, for a certaine he ſhould be left very naked. For ſayth <hi>Alchimius</hi> the Philoſopher, if the ſheep ſhould take thy garments from thee, the kine thy ſhoes, the worms thy ſilke, the earth thy linnen, the vines thy wine, the corne thy bread, the trees their fruit, the fountaynes their waters; tell mee I pray thee, of thy ſelfe, and by thy ſelfe, what ſhouldſt thou haue, what ſhouldeſt thou be worth or what ſhouldeſt thou bee able to doe? <hi>Horace</hi> ſayth to this purpoſe, Be not prowd like a lion, nor exaſperate thy ſelfe like an ounce: for if euery one would take from thy houſe &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:3666:185"/>that which is his, there would be no liuing creature more baſe tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou, ſeeing that thou haſt neither induſtry to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine thy ſelfe, nor weapons to defend thy ſelfe. Wee haue ſaid all this, to proue that if <hi>Tobias</hi> was a pilgrime, wee are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo pilgrimes. But alas alas, hee is accompanied with the good Angel who keepeth him, and we compaſſed with a thouſand enemies vvhich beſiege vs. Doe not wee, trow you, take our voiage beſet with a thouſand perils, and hindered with as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny troubles, conſidering that the deuill doth tempt vs, the fleſh moleſt and prouoke vs, the world deceiue vs, friends faile vs, our heart ſorroweth, our health decaieth, and our life daily ſhorteneth? The figure ſayth, that as <hi>Tobias</hi> went on his iourney, the fiſh came to the bancke to ſwallow him vp, whereof in the end hee receiued more profite than feare, inſomuch that by the ſame fiſh, of vvhich hee thought hee ſhould haue beene deuoured, his father receiued remedy. What was that great fiſh, of which <hi>Tobias</hi> thought he ſhould haue been deuoured, but only the ſonne of the eternall God vvhen he came to redeeme the vvorld? The fiſh vvas bred in the bottome of the riuer, and the ſonne of God was borne in the boſome of the eternall Father; and how deepe ſoeuer the riuer Tygris vvas, yet the ſea of the diuine eſſence is farre more deeper. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his booke of the Trinity ſayth, Wilt thou ſee how much more deeper the eternity of the Father and of his ſonne is, than the ſea? For it is poſsible to empty the ſea for all his greatneſſe, but for the ſecrets of the holy Trinity, it is impoſsible fully to vnderſtand. The fiſhe comming out of the vvater droue young <hi>Tobias</hi> into a great feare, but Chriſt cauſed a greater feare when hee came into the vvorld, ſeeing the Angels bowed themſelues, the kings adored him, the ſtarres vvere changed, the Iewes were moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and the deuils vvere aſeard. The feare vvhich the fiſh put <hi>Tobias</hi> in, continued but halfe an houre, but the fear which Chriſt put the vvorld in, dureth vntill this day: for being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feard and amazed, the Iews and Pagans cannot yet perſuade themſelues, that Chriſt ſhould be the God who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they ſhould
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:3666:186"/>beleeue in, and the Lord which ſhall iudge them. When that fiſh went out of the riuer to the bancke, of two which were there preſent, the one which was the Angel knew him, &amp; the other, which was <hi>Tobias</hi> was afeard: and euen ſo in like maner when the ſonne of God came downe from heauen vnto the earth, the Synagogue was ſcandalized, and the church recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him, in ſo much that according vnto old <hi>Simeons</hi> prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, this diuine fiſh came to the ſhore of the world, for the reſurrection of the good, and the ſcandale of the wicked. <hi>Praeparauit dominus piſcem grandem vt deglutiret Ionam,</hi> ſayth the holy Scripture, <hi>Ionas</hi> 2. As if hee would ſay, At the very inſtant when the cruell Marriners did caſt the Prophet <hi>Ionas</hi> into the bottome of the ſea, immediately our Lord prepared a great fiſh, which ſwallowed him aliue, and which kept him in his bowels ſafe and ſound. As before wee met with <hi>Tobias</hi> and his fiſh, ſo now wee haue lighte vpon <hi>Ionas</hi> and his fiſh, whereof the one was greatly afeard, and the other ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vp, by reaſon whereof wee muſt ſeeke out ſome ſecret in them, and diſcouer ſome myſtery in the expounding of them. Whoſe figure doth <hi>Ionas</hi> repreſent, but onely the good and godly, and who were the Marriners which threw him into the ſea but onely wicked men? Then the Marriners doe caſt <hi>Ionas</hi> into the ſea, when the wicked doe perſecute and caſt downe the good, becauſe there is no greater torment to a naughty man, than to heare a good man praiſed in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Of all thoſe which were in that ſhip onely <hi>Ionas</hi> was a holy and vertuous man, as it doth plainly appeare, becauſe there was no one which ſpake againſt the throwing of him into the ſea, but were all of one opinion in that fact: for albeit naughty men bee ſometime at variance among themſelues, yet in doing of miſchiefe they eaſily agree in one. O in what greater danger good mens fame and credite is in, among the wicked, than their liues and goods in the deepe ſeas which is plainly ſeene in that, that men did caſt the holy Prophet <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> from them, and the waters did receiue him into them, <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> vpon holy <hi>Iob</hi> ſayth, What ſhould become of the good,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:3666:186"/>if God had no care ouer them? What would not naughty men venter to doe with their ſmal ſhame &amp; leſſe conſcience, if their power ſhould ſtretch as far as their malice? If thou wilt ſee, my brother, the care that God hath to keepe thee, if thou haue a care to ſerue him, thou ſhalt ſee it in the holy Prophet <hi>Ionas,</hi> in that our Lord had prepared long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a fiſh to ſaue him, than the Marriners had determined to drowne him. The fiſh which did ſaue the Propher <hi>Ionas,</hi> did not put him by him, nor on him, nor vnder him, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him, and ſo kept him ſo warily in his entrals, that neither the fiſh durſt kill him, nor the waters drowne him. O that thy goodneſſe is infinit, &amp; thy charity very great, my good Ieſus, ſeeing that thou doeſt acquit all thoſe which the world doth condemne, loue thoſe which the world hateth, receiue thoſe which he caſteth off, foſter thoſe which he ſuffereth to periſh, and giueſt honour vnto all thoſe which the world doth diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. <hi>Aymon</hi> vpon <hi>Ionas</hi> ſaith, The Prophet <hi>Ionas</hi> ſlept in the loweſt part of the ſhip, &amp; the Marriners did caſt him into the bottome of the ſea, &amp; the Whale kept him in the ſecreteſt part of his bowels; I mean by this, that Chriſt dooth put vs in the daintieſt part of his bowels: for it is his propertie to keepe thoſe in his hart, which loue him from the hart. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith, If thou doe put Chriſt in thy eies to looke vpon him, he doth put thee in his to looke vpon thee; If thou place him in thy eares to heare him, he doth place thee in his to heare thee; if thou haue him in thy tongue to praiſe him, he hath thee in his to honour thee; if thou put him in thy heart to loue him, hee doth put thee in his to loue thee; inſomuch that where thou doeſt put Chriſt, Chriſt doth alſo in the ſame place put thee. Vpon thoſe words of the Pſalme, <hi>Iacta cogitatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tuu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi> S. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith. Yeeld thy ſelfe, my brother, yeeld thy ſelfe to the will of God, goe whither he will direct thee, do that which he commandeth thee, giue him that which he asketh of thee, beleeue him in that which he telleth thee: for as hee preſerued the Prophet <hi>Ionas</hi> in the Whales belly, ſo hee will preſerue thee in the dangers of this life. By this which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:3666:187"/>vnto the Prophet <hi>Ionas,</hi> it is very euident, that thre is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing firm &amp; ſtable but that which God doth ſuſtain, nor no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſure but that which God doth keep, ſeeing that that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophet was drie among the waters, found comfort in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, a remedy againſt death, and profite in his enemy. Did he not find a remedy againſt death, and profite in his enemy, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the water did not only not drowne him, nor the huge and great fiſh kill him, but was in the Whales belly with as great contentment and delight, as a Prince is in his roiall pallace? We haue ſpoken all this, becauſe no man ſhould omit to doe his duty, or goe with the truth, as farre as hee can, for feare of temptation, or ielouſie of naughty perſons; becauſe our Lord who deliuered <hi>Tobias</hi> that the fiſh ſhould not deuour him, and <hi>Ionas</hi> from the ſea that it ſhould not drowne him, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo deliuer thee from temptations which follow thee, &amp; from the enemies which perſecute thee.</p>

Although <hi>Tobias</hi> did not then know the Angel for to be an Angel, but thought him to bee another man like himſelfe, yet notwithſtanding he gaue credit vnto his ſpeech, and accepted of his counſell, ſo that <hi>Tobias</hi> did immediately kill and panch the fiſh vpon the ſand, which thought to eat
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:3666:187"/>him in the vvater. We doe in this place aduertiſe the curious Reader, that he ſhall not be able to vnderſtand this chapter, if he doe not read the chapter afore going, becauſe this figure of <hi>Tobias</hi> vvas there begun, and from thence is cited. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue then this figure, the text ſayth, that <hi>Tobias</hi> did ſit vpon the fiſh, and tooke him by the ſinnes neer vnto the head, and by the gilles in the throat, and drew him to the ſand, &amp; there did cut off his head and ſtrip him, and tooke out his heart &amp; liuer, and kept his gaule for himſelfe, and did eat part of him, and ſalted the reſt for his iourney. Who is <hi>Tobias</hi> but the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daicall people? What was the fierce ſea but the paſsion of Chriſt? And vvhat vvas the great fiſh but the ſame Chriſt? And vvhat vvas the ſand vvhere the fiſh was panched, but the high Mount of Caluary where Chriſt vvas put to death? <hi>Tobias</hi> did greatiuſtice vpon that vnhappie fiſh, vvhen hee panched him on the ſands; but the Synagogue did farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cruelties vpon Chriſt vvhen they tooke Chriſts life away on the Mount of Caluary: for if <hi>Tobias</hi> did kill the fiſh, it vvas becauſe the Angell vvhich kept him did ſo command him, but if the Synagogue did put Chriſt to death, it was done of meere enuy and malice. For the better vnderſtanding of this place, it is here to bee noted, that it was done by a continuall miracle, that Chriſt did neuer ſuffer his moſt holy ſoule to communicate and impart her glory vnto his body, becauſe that if he had not hindered that, his body had not ben paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at all. It was for no other cauſe but <hi>Propter noſtram ſalutë,</hi> that our great Redeemer ſuffered the death vpon the croſſe as if he had been a ſinner. <hi>Candolfus</hi> ſayth, Chriſt ſometimes gaue place, that the glory of his ſoule ſhould redound and fall vpon the members of his body, as it happened in the hill Thabor, by reaſon vvhereof his precious fleſh vvas ſo tender in ſuffering, and ſo paſsing deſirous to returne to the fruition of the ſame glory, that the abſence and delay of that diuine and heauenly comfort did bring Chriſt moſt grieuous torment. Vpon thoſe vvords of the Pſalme, <hi>Abyſſus abyſsum
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:3666:188"/>inuocat.</hi> Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> ſayth, for as much as the ſoule of the ſonne of God vvas full of glory, and his precious body loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with grieuous paine and anguiſh, O how oftentimes the depth of his trauailes and griefes did feruently deſire and ſigh after the depth of his comfort and conſolation, the vvhich his eternall Father vvould not impart vnto him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till hee had ended the redemption of the vvorld. O great goodneſſe, O infinite charity! who but thou, O my good Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, vvas hungry vvith bread in his hand, thirſty vvith vvater in his mouth, naked vvith garments in his cheſts, ſad and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with glory in his ſoule? Vpon thoſe vvords, <hi>Tristis eſt anima mea.</hi> S. <hi>Barnard</hi> ſayth, It is no maruell if my ſoule bee ſorrowfull, and full of anguiſh, becauſe the houre of my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and felicity is not yet come: but in thee O good Ieſus, why ſhould thy fleſh bee ſo wearied? And why ſhould thy ſoule be comfortleſſe, ſeeing that thou carrieſt with thee all the glory which is in heauen or in earth. <hi>Vbertinus</hi> vpon this place ſayth, The Redeemer of the world being in the agony of death, and very neere the end of his life, remembring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe of that heauenly comfort and diuine influence, vvhich from the glory of his ſoule was woont to bee imparted to his precious body, ſpake this word <hi>Sitio,</hi> as if he would ſay, O how great the thirſt is vvhich I ſuffer in this laſt houre, and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble agony, to vvit, of that influence and heauenly comfort, which was woont to bee imparted from my owne ſoule vnto my owne fleſh, becauſe this death and paſsion which my owne Father doth lay vpon this my weake fleſh, is not onely grieuous, but doth alſo exceed all other humane puniſhment. The great thirſt that Chriſt ſuffered vpon the croſſe, and the cooling vvater which hee deſired, was not the water of the fountain of the hill Lybanus, nor yet that which ran in the riuer Silo, but that heauenly conſolation which the glory of his ſoule vvas vvont to cauſe in him, for that other humane thirſt could not ſo much grieue him, conſidering how neere hee vvas to the end of his life. Wee haue
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:3666:188"/>vſed all this diſcourſe to extoll the word of the figure which ſayth, <hi>Et traxit piſcem in ſiccum,</hi> It is to bee vnderſtood, that young <hi>Tobias</hi> did kill the fiſh vpon the ſand, vvhich would haue killed him in the water. When, thinkeſt thou, did <hi>Tobias</hi> draw the fiſh vpon drie land, but vvhen the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Father did leaue his bleſſed ſonne vpon the croſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any humane conſolation? O how drie was that drie tree vpon which the heauenly fiſh hanged, vvho hauing been brought vp in the deepe ſea of the diuine eſſence, had not there ſo much as one drop of water to drinke. What can be pitied more in this life, than for a fiſh hauing been brought vp in the water, yet afterward to die for vvant of vvater? <hi>Tobias</hi> fiſh was hard by the vvater ſide, and yet died vvith thirſt, and Chriſts fleſh vvas coupeled with his holy ſoule, and died alſo vvith thirſt, becauſe the eternall Father to giue vs drinke of his water of heauen, killed his owne onely ſonne with thirſt, and brought him to die vpon the ſands of this world. If <hi>Tobias</hi> ſhould not haue drawne the fiſh to the land, hee could not haue maſtered him: if Chriſt had not become man, neither could he haue died, for how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it be naturall for vs to die, yet it is much more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall for God alwaies to liue. What meaneth it that the ſelfe ſame fiſh of whome <hi>Tobias</hi> thought he ſhould haue been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured, lay dead afterward at his feet, but that, that God which all the powers of heauen did feare and tremble at, we ſee now meek &amp; gentle, &amp; hanged vpon the tree? When God was nothing but God, &amp; in his own diuine eſſence being, all the world did feare him and tremble, but after that hee came vpon our ſandie humanity, &amp; ſet foot vpon the drineſſe of this world, hee who before made others afeard, was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe afraid, and he who before did throw downe others, fell himſelfe, and he who before enriched others became poore, and he who gaue all comfort wept himſelfe, and hee who kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led before died. <hi>Deſertum faciam mare eius &amp; ſiccabo venum e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius,</hi> ſaid God by the Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> chap. 51. as if he would ſay. I will make all his ſea as drie and without vvater, as
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:3666:189"/>deſart and ſolitary mountains are woont to bee, and I will cut off all the vaines and ſtreames of his depth, becauſe there ſhal flow no water at any end. Theſe words muſt curiouſly be expounded: for God to ſay, that the ſea ſhall bee as drie as a ſolitary mountaine, and that hee will cut off all the vaines of his courſe throughout all the world, ſeemeth to bee a new ſpeech, and a thing that was neuer ſeene to be beleeued. Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the letter, &amp; ſpeaking according vnto the ſence of theſe words, the eternal Father doth forewarne his precious ſonne, that he wil not onely deale with him like one which will not he are him, nor giue him any comfort, but alſo, that he will cut off all occaſions, whereby hec may any way receiue comfort; in ſo much that to make the ſea become a deſart, is to make of God a true man, and to cut off the vaines of the ſea, is to cut off all heauenly conſolation.

God ſaid by the mouth of his Prophet, <hi>Deſertum faciammare eius,</hi> ſpeaking of his ſon; and as he did prophecie, ſo he did accompliſh it: for when he hanged vpon the altar of the croſſe, he neuer made anſwere to any petition which hee made him, nor yet to quench his thirſt gaue him ſo much as one cup of water. What a ſtrange thing is this, O eternall Father, what a ſtrange thing is this? For thy baſtard &amp; abortiue childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou didſt drawwater out of the liuely rock, &amp; for thy lawful ſon haſt thou not ſo much as one drop?

Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the famine was at Samaria, thou didſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand the Crowes to carry the Prophet <hi>Helias</hi> food,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:3666:189"/>and the riuer Carith to giue him drinke, why doeſt thou not helpe thy owne ſonne, whom thou haſt ingendred of thy owne ſubſtance, with a little water, in this his extream thirſt? Conſidering that thou diddeſt turn the ſower waters of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rath to be ſweet, becauſe thoſe curſed people ſhould drinke of them, why wilt thou giue thy precious ſonne neither of the ſweet nor ſowre? O what great encreaſing of torments to Chriſt are framed in the figure of <hi>Tobias,</hi> ioined with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> ſeeing the one did draw the fiſh to the drie land, and the other made a deſart of the ſea! for vpon that drie tree of the croſſe, Chriſt was exceeding drie, ſeeing hee could not obtain a little water to drink of, and hee was alſo in a great deſart, ſeeing that hee found not ſo much as one friend to comfort himſelfe with. The fourth myſtery which the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure containeth is, that <hi>Tobias</hi> did open the fiſh, and took out his gaule and his heart; both which did him &amp; his afterwards great good, the one for his owne marriage, and the other to cure his fathers blindneſſe. It is greatly to be noted, that in all that fiſh, <hi>Tobias</hi> found nothing which was not worthy of the keeping, commodious and profitable in curing &amp; ſauerous in eating. The beſt that euer hath been, or ſhall be in the world, was the Creator and Redeemer of the world, whoſe words were holy, whoſe doctrine was profitable, whoſe workes were maruellous, and whoſe bowels were moſt louing. What did <hi>Tobias</hi> vnto that fiſh, that the Iewes did not vnto Chriſt? If the fiſh was drawne out of the riuer, ſo was Chriſt from the people; if the fiſh was put vpon drie land, ſo was Chriſt carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto the Mount of Caluary; if the fiſh was ſtripped, ſo was Chriſt whipped; if the fiſhes throat was cut, Chriſt was alſo crucified; if the fiſh was opened, ſo was Chriſt pierced with a ſpeare; if the fiſh was caſt into the fire, ſo was Chriſt alſo caſt into the ſepulchre. This which wee haue ſaid is but a little in reſpect of that which wee will ſay, and that is, that the holy catholike Church hath drawne out this bleſſed fiſhes gaule, with the which hee cureth vs, and heart with the which hee loueth vs, and liuer with the which he pardoneth vs, &amp; bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:3666:190"/>with which hee dooth cheriſh vs. O good Ieſus, O my ſoules health, who hath euer had or who euer ſhall haue a more louinge heart than thou to loue vs, or ſo ſound a liuer to pardon vs, or ſo profitable a gaule to cure vs, or ſuch tender bowels to cheriſh vs? What wilt thou denie me now, or what wilt thou not now giue mee, O my good Ieſus, ſeeing that for to ſhew thy clernency and mercy vpon me, thou art hanged vpon a drie tree, made a dead fiſh, opened, drawne and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elled for my ſake? What loue can bee compared vnto thy loue, ſeeing that for that which touched me, and not for any thing that belonged to thee, thou diddeſt conſent that they ſhould open thy heart, and diddeſt permit them to rend and teare thy bowels? What am I able to giue thee, O good Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, what can I giue thee, vnleſſe it be my heart which is filthy for thine which is cleane, my rotten liuer for thy vvhole one, my bitter gaule for thy ſweet one, and my wicked and hurtful bowels for thy moſt louing ones? Which are the greateſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes which are this day in heauen or earth, but the heart, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and bowels, which Chriſt left vnto his church? O how happy ſhould he be who ſhould haue ſuch relickes in his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtodie! for hauing thy heart in cuſtodie, how couldeſt thou chuſe but loue me, and hauing thy bowels in keeping, how wouldeſt thou but pardon me? How is it poſsible, O my good Ieſus, how is it poſsible that there ſhould bee any euill thing in thee, vvhen as the church hath thy precious gaule for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke? Since the beginning of the vvorld there hath neuer been any ſuch thing ſeene or heard, that is, that among the relickes vvhich the church dooth account for the beſt, the gaule is one of the moſt precious, becauſe that vvithout that bitter gaule, neither the world could haue beene redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, nor the Prince thereof haue beene ouercome. What is the gaule which the church keepeth in her treaſure, but only the bitter paſsion which Chriſt ſuffered? The richeſt iewell which the Synagogue had, was the Manna vvhich came from heauen, &amp; the greateſt treaſure which the church hath, is the gaule and paſsion of Chriſt. Betwixt vvhich two
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:3666:190"/>vvhat great difference there is, it is eaſily perceiued, becauſe that the profite &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity of our gaule doth continue vntil this day, &amp; will continue for euer; but the memory of that old Manna is already loſt. O glorious gaule, O happy gaul, which thou good Lord diddeſt leaue vnto thy catholick church! for if it did kill thee, it did make mee whole, if it gaue thee paine it gaue me glory, if it was gaule vnto thee, it was hony to me, &amp; if thou diddeſt end thy life vvith it, yet my ſoule vvas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed vvith it. Chriſts paſsio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vvas bitter gaule vnto Chriſt, and yet Chriſts death vvas a ſweet gaule for the redeeming of all the vvorld: for if vnto him there fell trauell &amp; pain, yet vnto vs there fell reſt &amp; quietneſſe, if it fell to his lot to ſuffer, yet it fell to vs to reioice &amp; be glad, if the ſoure fell vnto him, the ſweet fell vnto vs, in ſo much that hee choſe the gaule for himſelfe, and left the hony for vs. <hi>Iurauit patribus dare terrans fluentem lacte &amp; melle,</hi> ſaid the Prophet <hi>Moiſes</hi> Exod. 13; As if he vvould ſay, You ſhall well remember, O yee children of Iſrael, how you did agree vvith our Lord, &amp; he vvith you, &amp; that both of you by oth, that you ſhould neuer ſerue any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lord but him, and that he would giue you a land vvhich ſhould flow milke and hony. Notwithſtanding this oth, the children of Iſrael were ſuch naughty periures, that our Lord determined not to giue them a land which ſhould flow hony, but which ſhould bring them forth gaule, ſeeing hee made it batten for to ſow in, rugged and rough to trauell in, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthfull to dwell in, vveake in defence, drie to drinke in, and very poore to maintaine it ſelfe. God did make a farre better agreement vvith his Church, than vvith the Synagogue: for hee did not ſend vs a land vvhich ſhould bring forth honey but gaule, and therefore hee commanded vs to doe vvorkes vvhich ſhould bee very vnpleaſant and vnſauoury vnto ſenſualitie, although very conformable and very profitable. Chriſt did drinke bitter gaules, and gaue vs of the ſame to drinke: for vvhen hee vvas poore, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded vs to bee poore alſo, hee vvas perſecuted, and commanded vs to ſuffer perſecution, hee pardoned his iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:3666:191"/>and commanded vs to pardon ours; he ſuffered death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without fault, and charged vs to ſuffer it being in fault: all which things are as vnſauoury and bitter to accompliſh, as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is ſweet in eating. O what bitter gaules our Sauiour dooth command vs to eat, when he ſayth, The way is ſtreit which leadeth vnto life! but he turneth theſe bitter gaules into ſweet hony-combes, when hee ſayth, My yoke is ſweet: for if the way vnto heauen be bitter, yet it is made very ſweet, by going in Chriſts company. The yoke of the world doth make vs beleeue that he is of hony, and yet he is but of gaule; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe the yoke of Chriſt dooth threaten vs, that hee is of hony: for immediately as wee bow our heads to carry him, Chriſt putteth himſelfe on the other ſide to helpe vs.</p>

Theſe words king <hi>Dauid</hi> vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſhewing a new thirſt which hee had, and therevpon maketh a new petition, as if hee would ſay; O what a great thirſt my ſorrowfull ſoule endureth, and how ſhee deſireth to drinke of the fountaine of the water of life: for if ſhe cannot obtaine to drinke of it, ſhe can doe no leſſe but die with thirſt. The renowned king <hi>Dauid</hi> in very tender words, doth ſhew vs a new kind of thirſt, and a manner of drinking which was neuer before ſeene, and a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of a water which was neuer diſcouered before, &amp; a name of a fountaine neuer before heard of. Firſt he ſayth, that hee endureth thirſt, ſecondly, that the thirſt is in his ſoule, third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that his thirſt is of the water of the fountaine, fourthly,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:3666:191"/>that the fountaine is of water of life; and laſtly, it is called a diuine fountaine. It is neceſſary, that wee firſt examine, what thirſt <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaketh of, and what water he deſireth to drink of: for as there are many kinds of waters, and many ſorts of ſuch as are thirſty, ſo there is alſo many kinds of thirſte, and many things wherewith to quench the ſame. If <hi>Euripides</hi> doe not deceiue vs, corporall thirſt is cauſed of the hear of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, or of the inflaming of choler, or of eating ſalt things, ſo that indeed true thirſt is nothing elſe but ouermuch heat, and want of moiſture. With this corporall thirſt the people of Iſrael was troubled in the wilderneſſe, and <hi>Dauid</hi> when he deſired the water of Bethleem, and the captaine <hi>Siſara</hi> when hee fled from the battaile, and alſo <hi>Sampſon</hi> when there gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed out water vnto him out of an aſſes iawe bone. King <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes</hi> alſo was troubled with this thirſt, when flying from the battaile, he was glad of water at a poore mans hands. And this thirſt is very common and weariſome, and coſtly, if it bee to be quenched with wine, and dangerous vnto thoſe which giue themſelues to drinke too much of it. The thirſt which the poore Iſraelites ſuffered in the wilderneſſe, and the water which they drank out of the ro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k, did coſt them very deerly; for at the ſame time they dranke and wept. It did coſt the poore captaine <hi>Siſarah</hi> very deerely alſo, when hee did aske the Propheteſſe <hi>Debora</hi> for drinke: for at the ſame time ſhee gaue him a cup of milke to drinke, and put a pogge in his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to kill him with. When great king <hi>Dauid</hi> thirſted after the water of the ceſterne neere vnto Bethleem, although his ſeruants did bring him of it, hee would not drinke of it, nor durſt not taſt it. This materiall thirſt, which doth weary and moleſt vs daily, is ſuch, that there is no wine in the world, which can wholly quench it, nor any water that can ſo coale it, but it will come againe. Which is eaſily perceiued; for if we drinke at dinner, wee drinke better at ſupper, and the more a man doth drinke, the more he may, and although we kill our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hirſt for a time, yet it is not fully taken away. To come then vnto our purpoſe, is this the thirſt which the Prophet ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:3666:192"/>of, and whereof hee complaineth? This ſhould not bee his thirſt, this ſhould not be his anxiety, nor yet his complaint, nor that which he ſo feruently deſired: for being as he was, ſo mighty and great a king, hee wanted neither noble wines to drinke of, nor dainty waters to recreate himſelf withal. There were three ceſterns of water in Ieruſalem; the one at the gate called Salinaria, where all thoſe of the citie dranke of, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hard by the Mount Sion, where thoſe drank which were out of the city, &amp; the other at the gate of the Temple, where the fleſh which was ſacrificed was waſhed. Seeing then that there were ſo many ceſternes in Ieruſalem, who could hinder <hi>Dauid</hi> of them, or let him for drinking of that cold water? If he would not drinke of theſe waters, becauſe they were ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, had he not the riuer Iordane hard by? Had he not hard by the floud Cedron, which came from the Mount Lybanus? If he deſired water of the well, in Syon he had it; if fountaine water, in Bethleem he had it; if wine made of grapes, in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rude he had it; if liquor made of dates, it was brought out of Egypt: ſo that if his thirſt had been like vnto ours, hee had more meanes to quench it, than that thirſt which hee ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. This is not the thirſt which moleſted him, nor the griefe which troubled him: for if the thirſt which hee endured had proceeded fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the heat of the liuer, or of eating of ſalt meats, it is not to bee thought that hee would haue enregiſtred it in holy Pſalms. O renowned Prince and mighty king, wilt thou not tell what thy thirſt was of? If you will know after what I thirſted, where my griefe lay, and what the paine was which I endured, I let you vnderſtand, <hi>Quòd ſitiuit anima mea ad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um fontem viuum;</hi> and the meaning this, O ſorrowfull man that I am and comfortleſſe, ſeeing that the thirſt which I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure proceedeth not of a corrupted liuer, for mine is ſound &amp; whole, nor of burnt choller, for there is no ſuch thing in me: my thirſt is then not that which the body ſuffereth, but that which my ſorrowfull ſoule endureth. The thirſt which I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and the drineſſe which I abide is ſo hard to bee extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, that no liuing creature is able to take it from me, nor any
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:3666:192"/>water to quench it. O happy is the ſoule which thirſteth after nothing, but after our Lord! for looke what the thirſt is which the ſoule hath, ſuch is the water which ſhe ſeeketh to mittigate it with. O that this is a diuine ſentence which the Prophet doth vtter vnto vs in this place! whereby wee are plainly taught, that the thirſt of the ſoule is farre different from the thirſt of the body, and that the thirſt of the ſpirit is one, and that of the fleſh another, that of the iuſt man one, and that of the ſinner another, and the heauenly thirſt one, and the humane another. Whereby is the thirſt of the body quenched, but by drinking? And with what is the thirſt of the ſoule ſlackened, but by contemplation? And with what is the thirſt of the ſpirit killed, but by ſeruing God? And with what is the thirſt of the world eaſed, but by following the world? And what doth the iuſt thirſt after, but grace in this world, and glory in the other? And what thirſt hath the wicked, but to procure all meanes hee can the cockering of himſelfe? The humane thirſt is of humane thinges, and the heauenly thirſt is of heauenly things; and therevpon it is, that what our intention is which we haue in our hearts, ſuch is the thirſt which wee ſuffer in this world. If our principall intent be to be greater in the world, all our thirſt is to climbe high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, if to bee richer, then our thirſt is in gathering goods toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, inſomuch that ſuch as our thoughts are, ſuch are the liues we lead. Tell me, I pray thee, what doth the prowd man hunt after, but to bee of great authority, what doth the enuious man ſhoot at, but to throw downe another, what doth the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious man intend, but how to reuenge vpon his enemy, what dooth the glutton follow but dainties for the belly? This is the thirſt which the wicked doe ſuffer; and that which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee ſpoken without teares is, that their life is ſooner at an end, than the thirſt of their wickedneſſe is quenched. S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> vpon the Pſalms ſayth, In great ſinners and obſtinate hearts, although the prowd man doe die, yet pride dieth not, although the enuious man die, yet enuy dieth not, although the couetous man die, yet couetouſneſſe dieth not, although
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:3666:193"/>the carnall man doe die, yet his carnality dieth not, inſomuch that the vicious man is dead, before that his vice is at an end. Why, thinkeſt thou, doe wee ſay that the vicious man is dead before his vice is at an end, but becauſe that if the time, in the which he ſinned, bee ended and paſt, yet his deſire of further ſinning is not ended. S. <hi>Ierom</hi> ſaith, In damned &amp; vnfortunate perſons, their torments are therefore infinit, becauſe their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of ſinning were alſo infinit, becauſe our Lord doth make greater reckoning of that which the hart doth deſire, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that vvhich the hands doe worke. S. <hi>Baſil</hi> vpon the Pſalmes ſayth, O how much more dangerous is the thirſt which a naughtie mans heart dooth ſuffer, than that vvhich the body doth endure! becauſe this is aſſuaged vvith a cup of cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but the thirſt of the heart is mittigated by adding ſinne vnto ſinne; and therevpon it is, that if the thirſty man take pleaſure in drinking, the great ſinner taketh farre more in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending. Let mee bee no more credited, if I vvere not told of one vvhich had not left onely one vice vntried, nor let paſſe one day wherein hee had not ſinned. What ſhall vvee thinke of him, but that if hee had alwaies liued, hee vvould alwaies haue ſinned? What a remediles thirſt ſhould he haue after ſinne, and vvhat a friend ſhould he be of vvic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked perſons, vvho left no ſinne vvhich he proued not, nor no day vvherin he offended not? The rich couetous man which vvas in hell, did not complaine of the fire vvhich did burne him, nor of the cold vvhich pinched him, nor of the hunger vvhich hee endured, but of the great thirſt which tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, and therefore asked no other fauour of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but that hee would coole and refreſh his tongue with a drop of vvater: it was the iuſt iudgement of God, that ſeeing hee had no other thirſt in this world, but of wealth, authority, and power, and treaſure, that hee ſhould haue an exceſsiue thirſt in the other, not of wealth and authoritie, but of a bare cup of water. Loe thus you haue ſeene it proued, how the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment followeth the offence, and how one thirſt ſucceedeth another. But alas alas, the thirſt of this world hath an end, but
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:3666:193"/>the thirſt of the other world ſhall dure alwaies without end.</p>

Although the Apoſtle doe ſay, that our Lord is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found in his iudgements, yet in thoſe thinges which touch the profite of his creatures, he is plaine and eaſie: for if hee bee well pleaſed, he doth preſently ſhew it, and if he be angry, he doth immediately complaine. When <hi>Abraham</hi> had ended the ſacrifice of his ſonne <hi>Iſaac,</hi> our Lord did immediately thanke him for it, and when king <hi>Dauid</hi> had ended his adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery with <hi>Berſabee,</hi> he complained out of hand: for our Lord is ſo farre without diſsimulation and malice, that he doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther faine himſelfe to bee content, nor denie himſelfe to bee angry. What more would wee haue God to doe for vs, than like a good Lord, bee thankfull for that which wee doe in his ſeruice, and like a good friend admoniſh vs of that which we ſhould doe for him, and like a pittifull Father correct vs when we doe any thing againſt him?

<pb n="382" facs="tcp:3666:194"/>vnleſſe it be for his further profite. If it were ſo, that as we do leaue one man for another, ſo wee ſhould leaue one God to dwell vvith a better, it were a thing to be borne vvithall, but ſeeing that there is but one true God, how is it poſsible to meet vvith a better God, or yet any ſo good? What other thing is it to forſake God for the creature, but to leaue the kernell for the ſhell, the fruit for the rinde, the roſe for the thorne, the floure for the bran, and the fountaine for the ſtreame? Therefore like an angry Lord, and a man greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuried, God complaineth and ſayth, <hi>Me dereliquerunt fontem aquae viuae,</hi> for there can be no greater madneſſe in the world, than to leaue the Creator for the creature, the Lord for the ſeruant, the iuſt for the ſinner, and the righteous for the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt, and that vvhich is euerlaſting for that vvhich is tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.

O how our Lord hath ſhamed vs in theſe words, and embaſed vs in ſaying by the Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> that all our vvorkes are nothing but old broken ceſternes, and puddles wherein there is nothing commonly but reeds and duckeweed, dirt &amp; mire, ſtinking vvaer, and venomous adders. Our Lord doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare vs vvith great reaſon vnto that vvhich hee dooth name, and doth ſcorne and mocke vs fitly by it, becauſe the ſinnes vvhich are in our ſoules, are farre vvorſer than thoſe filthes which are found in ſtanding puddels.

Woe be vnto me, woe be vnto me, what doe I ſay that I anſwered preſently, when ſin called at my doore, ſeeing that very oft before it doth call at my doore, I goe vp and downe ſeeking it from houſe to houſe? Our workes are alſo like vnto ſtanding puddle, whoſe proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is to be troubled and thicke to looke into, and very ſtinking to drinke. When our Lord ſayth by the Prophet <hi>Eſaias, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferte malum cogitationum veſtrarum ab oculis meis,</hi> how ſhould he not deteſt our workes, ſeeing he ſaith, that all that we doe thinke of doth ſtinke? <hi>Anſelmus</hi> ſayth, If we will haue God accept of that which wee doe, it is neceſſary that all that bee cleane which wee thinke of, for God doth not ſo much looke vnto that which vve be, as vnto that vvhich vvee would bee if vve could. O my ſoule, O my heart, what is in me that hath a good ſauour, and what is in thee vvhich doth not ſtinke? Dooth not my body ſtinke with the euill vvorkes vvhich I doe, my fleſh vvith ſloth, my mouth with lies, my life vvith couetouſneſſe, and my heart vvith malice. S. <hi>Barnard</hi> ſayth, According vnto the time vvhich I haue liued, and according vnto the ſmall profite vvhich I haue done, I am partly weary
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:3666:195"/>of my life, and partly afeard to die: for if I behold my fleſh, it is now ſtinking with yeares, and if I looke vnto my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they are alſo ruſty with age. All my workes are ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant and corrupt, and my conditions ſo ſtinking, that it is more tollerable to ſmell a dead carkaſſe with my noſe, than vnto thee O my God, to ſmell this filthy heart of mine. Our workes are alſo like vnto the frogges which are bred in pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, whoſe property is to make the water loathſome, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend our eares with their croaking. S. <hi>Barnard</hi> vpon the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles ſayth, Looke how beautifull a thing it is to ſee a ſoule when ſhee is in the ſtate of grace, ſo deformed a thing it is to ſee her when ſhe is darkened with ſinne; for in the one eſtate God is neuer ſatiſfied in looking vpon her, and in the other he will neuer hear her. The properties of frogs are theſe, they are euil fauoured to looke vpon, loathſome to touch, vnplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to heare, and monſtrous to eat of: for if it be well marked, they haue no ſcales like a fiſh, nor feathers like a bird. <hi>Origen</hi> talking of the frogs of Egypt ſayth, A frog and worſe than a frog is that ſoule, which in the fountain of his goodneſſe doth not bath her ſelfe; becauſe we may well ſay of ſuch a ſoule, that ſhe is euill fauoured in reſpect of her ſinne, loathſome in reſpect of her puniſhment, and not to be ſuffered in reſpect of her infamie. The quality of the frog is to croake night &amp; day, &amp; it is the condition of a naughty man alwaies to complain, becauſe it is one of the infelicities which naughty me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> endure in this life, that they complaine of all things, and liue diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. It is alſo to be weighed, that how well ſoeuer the ſtones of a poole bee ioined, yet the water dooth wooſe betweene them vnleſſe they bee well mortered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe that the propertie of the water is to moiſten that which it toucheth, and ſeeke alwaies where it may find a place to iſſue out. What thinkeſt thou is the clay and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the which a holy ſoule is faſtened together, but only Gods holy grace? <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in an Homily ſaith, What dooth it auaile vs to haue in the poole of our ſoule, the vertue of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, the goodneſſe of patience, the wealth of almes giuing,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:3666:195"/>and the perfection of abſtinence, if there want the clay and pitch of charity to keepe them togither? S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> vpon <hi>Beati immaculati</hi> ſayth, Let vs not caſt away our ſelues, and grieue becauſe our Lord wil not impart his graces vnto vs, but becauſe we know not how to keepe them when we haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, becauſe there is required greater vertue to keepe that which is gotten, than to recouer that which was loſt. O what great reaſon our Lord hath to ſay and complaine of all the good turnes that he doth vs, and of all the fauours which he doth beſtow vpon vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for we caſt them al into an old puddle, where we haue nothing but the dirt of couetouſneſſe, the frogges of vainglory, the reeds and duckeweeds of hypocriſie, and the tod-poole of lechery.</p>

Theſe words are full of matter, and containe deep myſteries in them. For as they were prophecied by holy <hi>Iob,</hi> ſo they were fulfilled by the ſonne of God, when as on the altar of the croſſe hee taſted a cup of ſuch bitter poyſon, that in taſting of it his life went preſently out of his body. The Philoſopher in his ſecond booke <hi>De generatione</hi> ſayth, That the life of a reaſonable man dooth conſiſt in the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the radicall or naturall moiſture, and in the conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of natural heat; and that is the only reaſon why nature
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:3666:196"/>doth deſire meat and drinke of vs; for by eating and drinking that humor is alwaies preſerued. Wee ſee oftentimes men of ninty or a hundred years die, and yet neuer complaine of any griefe, and the reaſon is, becauſe that that naturall moiſture was ended in them, and their naturall heat was extinguiſhed in them, and therefore we may ſay of ſuch that their life did rather end, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they died. Now that we muſt eat &amp; drink of neceſsity, which of theſe two is moſt agreeable vnto na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and which leſſe grieuous? If <hi>Aristotle</hi> doe not deceiue vs in his booke <hi>De ſecretis ſecretorum,</hi> this queſtion was deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, and in his preſence through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſputed on, becauſe that at the table of that mighty prince no man was admitted to ſpeake but his captains which ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his warres, or Philoſophers which gouerned his houſe. The concluſion which thoſe learned men gaue was, that it was farre more pleaſing and agreeable vnto mans nature to drinke than to eat, and their reaſon was, becauſe that drinke doth aſſuage the thirſt, which is a very troubleſome &amp; offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue thing to ſuffer, and that it hath neither need of a knife to cut it, nor teeth to chew it, <hi>Vltimum refugium naturae eſt potus,</hi> ſaid the Philoſopoher, as if he ſhould ſay, The laſt refuge that nature doth giue to ſuſtaine vs withal, is the ſtrength to drink, which is eaſily perceiued in thoſe which are ſicke, whereof we ſee ſome, partly by reaſon of their long infirmity, partly by reaſon of their old age, loſe their ſight, ſome their hearing, ſome their ſmelling, ſome their eating, and yet none loſe their drinking. What old man haue wee ſeene in our daies in the world who hath not beene able to drinke a cup of wine? <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſcorus</hi> an old Phiſitian ſayth, that of what age or condition a man be, he is eaſilier comforted with drink than meat. And therefore ſeeing that is more neceſſary for me to drinke than to eat, in times paſt when meats at certaine times were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, they did not limit their cups in drinking: for looke how much a man is recreated and refreſhed when hee drinketh at his pleaſure, ſo much hee is tormented and afflicted when
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:3666:196"/>endureth thirſt; and therevpon the Philoſopher ſayth in his booke <hi>De ſomno &amp; vigilia,</hi> That there is no torment equall vnto that, when a man is denied his drinke, and kept from ſleepe. <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſayth, That the great tyrant <hi>Dennis</hi> gaue his enemies no other torment, but much ſalt meat to eat, and no drinke to drinke, and made them labour hard, and not permit them to ſleepe. <hi>Cicero</hi> in an Epiſtle ſayth, That nature is a great enemy to three things, that is, of griefe and ſorrow, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it waſteth the bones, of great weakeneſſe, and of great thirſt, with the which choller is enflamed. To come then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our purpoſe, if to ſuffer thirſt and want ſleepe be two great torments, who was more tormented with theſe than Chriſt was? For if we talke of his ſleepe, we know well that he had not ſlept from the laſt night which hee ſlept in Bethania, and if we talke when he dranke from the time that hee cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated his laſt ſupper, he neuer drunke drop of water. <hi>Barnard</hi> ſayth, Conſidering the hunger which hee had ſuffered, the torments which were giuen him, the bloud which they drew from him, the iourney which hee went, doeſt thou not think that my good Ieſus had great cauſe to want ſleepe, and bee very thirſtie? <hi>Caſsiodorus</hi> ſayth, Why wilt thou, O my good Lord, why wilt thou haue mee to occupy my pen in ſhewing how thirſtie thou waſt vpon the croſſe, and how much ſleepe thou diddeſt want, conſidering that there vvas no kind of puniſhment vvhich vvas not experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon thee? <hi>Anſelmus</hi> ſayth, Who but thou, O my good Ieſus, who but thou, diddeſt ſuffer in the manger cold, in Egypt baniſhment, on the way wearineſſe, in the palace ſcorning and mocking, on the croſſe thirſt, in thy honour infamie, and in thy perſon death? There vvere as <hi>Barnard</hi> ſayth fiue torments, which did moſt of all afflict Chriſt vpon the croſſe, that is to ſay, the ſtripes of the whip which did open his ſhoulders, the nailes which pierced his hands, the thornes which tore his Temples, the ſpettle which the hangmen did ſpet at him, and the thirſt vvhich did burne his bowels. Wee muſt take great compaſsion of
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:3666:197"/>the thirſt which Chriſt ſuffered vpon the croſſe, and wee are to wonder at the remedy which they gaue him for it: for in ſteed of water they gaue him gaule mingled vvith mirrhe, and inſteed of wine pure vineger. If wee maruell that Chriſt tooke theſe cruell drinkes, wee are much more to maruell to ſee that Chriſt himſelfe with his owne mouth did aske for them: for if he had not ſaid <hi>Sitio,</hi> I am a thirſt, no man durſt haue giuen him gaule and wine mingled with mirre. <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi> ſayth, Chriſt ſaw thoſe cups of g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

God forbid that my penne ſhould vvrite ſuch blaſphemy, of
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:3666:197"/>my good Ieſus, vnto whome no man offered gaule and vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, no man entreated him vnto it, no man forced him to take it, but he of his owne will ſaid <hi>Sitio,</hi> I am a thirſt and drie: for if hee would haue diſſembled his thirſt, and held his tongue, they would neuer haue giuen him that deteſtable drinke. <hi>Iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> ſayth, What man, or what Angel is able to reach vnto this ſecret, that is, that the ſonne of God being then to giue vp his laſt breath, yet ſhould ſay, that hee thirſted after a cup of water? Why doeſt thou ſay ſo late <hi>Sitio,</hi> and aske either for wine or water? for ſeeing that thou art euen at the laſt fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well of thy life, it cannot otherwiſe be, but as thou art a drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, thy ſoule muſt depart from thee. It had been a far leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer trouble and griefe, to haue endured thirſt halfe a quarter of an houre which Chriſt had to liue, than haue ſuffered the thornes which boared through his head, and all the reſt of the torments which he had paſſed through that day, but that his pleaſure was to ſuffer them all, and complaine of his thirſt only, becauſe the thornes were onely a torment; but his thirſt ſignified a myſtery vnto his Church. There is a myſtery in Chriſts being a thirſt, there is a myſtery in that that he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted it, there is a myſtery in that they gaue him wine min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with mire, and another in that they mixed it with gaule, there is a myſtery in that they offered it him in a reed, and giuing him it with Iſope containeth a myſtery, and in that he taſted of it and did not drinke it there is alſo a myſtery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. If it be diligently looked into, the myſtery of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament where Chriſt communicated with his diſciples ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, and the Sermon with the which he did comfort the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the praier which he made when hee did ſweat bloud alſo excepted, there is no myſtery written with ſo many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as this of the thirſt which Chriſt ſuffered, &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he complained. And therefore marke with great heed all that the holy Scripture writeth of Chriſts thirſtines; becauſe that with how many more circumſtances a thing is vttered in Scripture, to ſo many more weightier conſiderations it dooth inuite vs.</p>

Theſe wordes are vttered by the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Father, ſpeaking with his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſonne, when he ſent him into the world, and they are as if hee would ſay: being my onely begotten ſonne, &amp; taking vpon thee ſo hard an enterpriſe, as is the redeeming of the world, thou ſhouldſt be content to reſtore the houſe of <hi>Iacob</hi> only, and the dregs of Iſrael, becauſe the end why I ſend thee into the world is, to giue light vnto al the Gentiles, and redeeme all the whole world. There are brought in in that communication, the Father which ſpeaketh, the ſonne vnto whom he ſpeaketh, the Synagogue of whom he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, and the end why hee is ſent, and alſo the great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the iourney, ſeeing that by the meanes thereof hee will lighten the blindneſſe of the Gentiles, and ſtreine the dregs of the Iewes. And when he ſayth, <hi>Vt ſis ſalus mea,</hi> our Lord doth highly extoll the loue which hee beareth vs, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one man doth commend an important affaire vnto another, the Father ſaith here vnto his ſon, that it tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth his owne ſafety and life, that a full &amp; generall redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be made of all men, not excluding any one at all. When the father ſayth vnto his ſonne, <hi>Dedi te in lucem gentium vt ſis ſalus mea,</hi> what will he ſay, but that it is moſt agreeable vnto his clemency, &amp; that he holdeth it for a point of his honour, that all enter in and be comprehended vnder his generall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, the wine and the dregs, the good and the bad, the Gentile and the Iew, the quicke and the dead. The Father
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:3666:198"/>who dooth commend vnto his ſonne the grounds and dregs, dooth hee not more earneſtſſy commend cleane and holy things? In Gods ſhop, the lees which hee caſteth abroad are better than all the wine that the diuell keepeth together. I meane, that one whom our Lord hath humbled and brought low, is better than all thoſe which the diuell hath lifted vp. And becauſe that our Lords calling of the Iewes lees and dregs of Iſrael, ſeemeth to be a ſcandalous &amp; iniurious ſpeech, it is neceſſary for vs to declare how theſe dregs tooke their foundation: for it is not poſsible for vs to expound the holy Scripture as we ſhould, vnleſſe wee doe firſt vnderſtand the letter.

Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> holy <hi>Iob</hi> thought with himſelfe, &amp; called to mind the time when he was rich and of great eſtimation, and very healthfull of body, and then ſaw himſelfe vpon a dunghill vviping wormes off his owne body, vvhat griefe of mind ſhould oppreſſe him, and vvhat a ſea of thoughts vveary him? When our Lord degraded and put out of their kingdomes <hi>Nabuchodono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer</hi> and <hi>Antiochus,</hi> if wee looke vvell vnto it, wee ſhall perceaue, that the teares which they wept, and the griefes which they complained on, were rather to thinke of the honours which they had loſt, than of the puniſhment which they preſently endured. <hi>Cleopatra</hi> queen of Egypt, <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> captaine of the Greeks, and ſtout <hi>Hannibal</hi> of the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginenſes, and the Conſul <hi>Cato</hi> among the Romans, ſlew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with their owne hands after that aduerſe fortune had taken away their honours.

For as the church ſayth, <hi>Sicut to colimus, ita nos viſita,</hi> Is it much that God ſhould be careleſſe in doing of vs good, if we grow cold in his ſeruice? S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth in an Homilie, When the ſonne of God came into the world to take fleſh vpon him, the Synagogue had fallen into decay long before, which they ſhall eaſily ſee to bee true, who will diligently read the Scriptures. For the Prophet <hi>Malachias</hi> doth call her ſoot, <hi>Ieremy</hi> droſſe, <hi>Baruch</hi> a putrified worm, <hi>Ezechiel</hi> a moth, <hi>Amos</hi> a wild vine, <hi>Abdias</hi> ſmoke, <hi>Oſee</hi> a ſinke: for as hee was wont to inuent names to honour thee, ſo now hee ſeeketh names of infamy to diſcredit thee. And like vnto one who
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:3666:199"/>is angry and diſcontented, God calleth his people of Iſrael dregs and ſinke, and ſoot, and ſmoke: for as the Iewes grew more and more in ſinnes, ſo God puniſhed them more and more, and quipped, and taunted them with new names. What greater iniury could he doe to them, or what greater reproch could hee vſe towards them than call them filthy dregs and rotten lees? <hi>Fulgentius</hi> in a Sermon ſayth, According vnto the prophecy of <hi>Eſayas,</hi> Can you, O you Iſraelites, denie mee that there is any thing left of your Prieſthood, of your royall ſcepter, of your rich temple, of your ancient kingdome, of your famous people, but the lees which ſmell, and the dregs which ſtinke? Chriſt found very ſtinking dregs, in al the Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Prieſthood, ſeeing we read of it in the books of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabees, that they gaue not the roome of the high Biſhop vnto him who beſt deſerued it, but vnto him who bought it for moſt money. The ſonne of God found very rotten dregs in the roiall ſcepter of Iuda, conſidering that it was vſurped of the Romanes, and tyrannized by Herods. Chriſt found fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy grounds in all the Scriptures, ſeeing that the Rabines had falſified them, and interpreted them according vnto their owne meaning. Chriſt found the Hebrew tongue ſtained in lees and dregs; and the reaſon was, becauſe that as the vnfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Iewes had been captiues in diuerſe parts, ſo they ſpake diuerſe languages. Was not the Synagogue now become ſtinking and filthy dregs, ſeeing that there was no vice in the world which was not found in her? In the Princes Chriſt found pride, in the Prieſts enuy, in the Phariſies hypocriſie, in the old men malice, in the young men ignorance, &amp; in the popular and vulgar ſort couetouſneſſe.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Cce ignis &amp; ligna: vbi est victima holocausti?</hi> Geneſis 22. Theſe lamentable ſpeeches paſſed betwixt the Father and the ſonne, the ſonne and the Father, in manner of a dialogue, the one asking and the other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering. The caſe was then this, that when <hi>Abraham</hi> had brought his ſonne <hi>Iſaac</hi> from among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and being gone vp to the hill with his hands bound, the wood ſet on a heap, and the fire kindled, and the ſword drawn to ſacrifice his ſonne, he ſaid vnto his Father; behold father, here is the wood and the fire made, where is the beaſt which ſhall bee ſacrificed? To this demand the ſorrowfull Father anſwered this, <hi>Dominus prouidebit ſibi victimam holocauſti, ſili mi;</hi> as if he would ſay, Take thou no care my ſonne, take no care? for the Lord will prouide a ſacrifice which ſhall be more acceptable vnto him, than all the ſacrifices of the world. This prophecie, which the Patriark <hi>Abraham</hi> vttereth, is ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; high, that although many haue read it, yet very few vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it: for although it be ſhort in words, yet the myſteries which it containeth are many. What meaneth this, O old <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> what meaneth this? God doth command thee to kill and burne, and ſacrifice and offer thy owne ſonne, and doeſt thou prophecy that our Lord will prouide for a ſacrifice farre better than this which thou doeſt bring? O high myſtery &amp; diuine Sacrament! for the holy man hauing his ſonne in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe to be ſacrificed, the wood prepared to caſt him into, the fire made to burne him, the ſword drawne to kill him, and a commandement from God to offer him, yet careleſly ſaith, that the Lord will prouide another ſacrifice. <hi>Abraham</hi> dooth not ſpeake here with the Synagogue his mother (for, for her the ſacrificing of <hi>Iſaac</hi> was prepared, which was the figure of a ſacrifice) but he ſpake with our mother the holy catholicke church, for whom God would prouide another new ſacrifice, which was Chriſt crucified, in whome all the ſacrifices of the law were to end, and the Sacraments of the church take their beginning. Becauſe all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might know that <hi>Abraham</hi> did not
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:3666:200"/>ſpeake of the ſacrifice of <hi>Iſaacs</hi> ſonne, but of the ſacrifice of Chriſt which was to come, our Lord ſaid not, that hee had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready prouided a ſacrifice, but that he would prouide; neither did he ſay that he would prouide it for another, but for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; neither that hee would prouide many, but one; neither that he would indifferently prouide for any, but a killed ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice laid whole on the altar. <hi>Theophilus</hi> vpon the Apoſtle ſayth, That in all the old Teſtament, there was no ſacrifice ſo excellent, nor ſo ſtrange, nor ſo coſtly, as that of <hi>Abraham</hi> &amp; <hi>Iſaac</hi> his ſonne. And ſeeing that <hi>Abraham</hi> the maker of that ſacrifice doth prophecie that there ſhall bee another ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice which ſhall excell his, why do not you, O you Iewes, receiue Chriſt as a true ſacrifice? Neither did <hi>Abraham</hi> ſay that he would prouide many ſacrifices but only one: for if we marke it well, it was the poore Synagogue which was loaden with many ſacrifices, and beleeued in many Chriſts, and offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red many Holocauſts; but the holy church hath but one ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, beleeueth but in one Chriſt, and doth offer but one Holocauſt. Neither doth <hi>Abraham</hi> ſay that the Lord would prouide a ſacrifice for any other but for himſelfe, ſeeing hee ſayth, <hi>Dominus prouidebit ſibi:</hi> for vntill the very inſtant and houre that his ſonne was crucified on the croſſe, he was neuer pleaſed nor pacified, for the offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which was done vnto him. Neither did <hi>Abraham</hi> ſay that he would prouide indiffere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly any ſacrifice, but ſpecially that ſacrifice which was called <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locauſtum,</hi> becauſe that in al other ſacrifices there remained al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies one part for the prieſt to eat of, &amp; another for him which offered it for to take away. But it was not ſo in that ſacrifice which they called <hi>Holocauſtu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> becauſe that in it all the whole beaſt was quartered &amp; cut in peeces &amp; burnt, &amp; ſo being made aſhes was wholly offered vnto God. Was it not, think you, an Holocauſt, &amp; a great Holocauſt which Chriſt offered, ſeeing there was no ſpot in it wherby it ſhould be caſt away, nor any me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber in his body which was not tormented? To come then vnto our purpoſe, it is to be noted, that we haue made all this diſcourſe to proue that in the myſtery of this word <hi>Sitio</hi> which
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:3666:201"/>end, becauſe that the Iewes did but borrow them vntill our Lord ſhould prouide them a ſacrifice, which by <hi>Abraham</hi> he promiſed vnto all the world. <hi>Iſidorus</hi> vpon Geneſis ſayth, The ſacrifice which God promiſed to ſend into the world, ought to bee worthy of him vnto whom it was offered, and profitable vnto him who did offer it; which could not bee by dead calues, and the bloud of goats, and vnpleaſant liquors, nor yet with bloudy hands. How was it poſsible that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of time paſt ſhould pleaſe the Lord, or profit the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner which did offer them, ſeeing their altars did ſeeme rather butchers ſhambles, than temples of Prieſts? <hi>Rabanus</hi> ſayth, <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſacrifice was profitable vnto himſelfe, and hurtfull vnto his ſonne, ſeeing he ſhould there haue loſt his life; and becauſe we may know that this is true, the Lord did ordaine that <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſword ſhould onely threaten his ſonne <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and afterward kil the ſon of God. Our Lord ſeeing what ſmal benefite ſhould be gotten by the death of that child, &amp; what griefe it would cauſe vnto this old Father, although hee gaue him licenſe to draw his ſword, yet hee did not conſent that it ſhould come neere the child; the which our Lord would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer haue hindered, if the death of that child could haue ben ſufficient to redeeme al the world. God the Father was older than <hi>Abraham,</hi> and loued his ſonne better than <hi>Abraham</hi> did his: yet notwithſtanding all this, ſeeing that in that only ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice did conſiſt mans ſaluation, he conſented that they ſhould take his life from him. <hi>Eſichius</hi> vpon <hi>Leuiticus</hi> ſayth, That that which <hi>Abraham</hi> did, was only good vnto himſelfe alone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee did accompliſh that which was commanded him; but when he ſaid that the Lord would prouide a ſacrifice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelfe, that was profitable vnto all the world, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that by that prophecie wee were warranted and made ſure, that we ſhould be redeemed by the ſonne of God. <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> ſayth, That it is much to be noted, how that all the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the old law did proceed from two things only, that is, from the beaſts which they did kill, and the fruit which they plucked from trees. Of their beaſts they did offer the head
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:3666:201"/>and feet vnto the Lord, the caule, the fleſh, and the entralls, and of trees incenſe, ſtorax, fruit, grapes, aloes, mirrhe, oile, and ſweet odours. And God was not content only, that euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould offer what pleaſed himſelfe, but onely of that which God in the law comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded, that is, of beaſts that they ſhould offer the greateſt, of fruits the beſt, of perfumes the ſweeteſt, of mettales the richeſt, of liquors the moſt excellente. If we beleeue the Philoſopher in his book <hi>De animalibus,</hi> The firſt thing that is engendred is the heart, and the laſt the gaule: &amp; when a beaſt dieth it is contrary; for the firſt thing that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth is the gaule, and the heart the laſt thing that dieth. The Commentator ſayth, That as the gaule is the laſt thing that is ingendred in man ſo it is alſo the moſt filthieſt and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt thing that is in him. Of all liquors the wine is the moſt precious, and contrary no liquor worſer than the dregs of ſoure corrupted wine. Doeſt thou thinke, my brother, that we haue trauelled in vaine in prouing vnto thee, that the gaule is the worſt part of the beaſt, and putrified dregs the worſt of liquors? The end why wee haue ſpoken all this is, becauſe that when the Redeemer of the world was dead with thirſt vpon the altar of the croſſe, they gaue him theſe two thinges to drinke, that is bitter gaule, which is the laſt and worſt part of the beaſt, and dregs and vineger which is the worſt of all liquors. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayth, The pureſt, cleareſt, and cleaneſt of the Synagogue was already ended and gone, and turned into vineger and lees, by reaſon wherof they gaue Chriſt nothing to drinke but gaule &amp; vineger, giuing vs ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to vnderſtand, that they did not giue him only that which they had in the Synagogue, but alſo that which themſelues were. For what was all the Synagogue but ſoure vineger, and bitter gaule? It was not without a high myſtery that they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered that which they did to Chriſt vpon the croſſe: for as the gaule is the laſt and the vildeſt thing that is in the beaſt, ſo the Synagogue was now at an end, and at the vvorſt of all her life, in ſo much that ſhee was become nothing els but a gaule of malice, and alſo vineger of couetouſneſſe. Saint
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:3666:202"/>
                  <hi>Ierome</hi> ſayth, Euen as vineger hath been good wine, becauſe it was gathered of the beſt of the vine, ſo the people of the Iews were ſomtimes good, becauſe they had good me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among them; in ſo much that there is no other meaning in that they gaue Chriſt wine mingled with mire, and ſoure vineger to drinke, but that the people were now corrupted, and ſcarſe one good man left among them. How came this hap among you, O you Iewes, that all the wine of your veſſels is become ſoure vineger, and all the hony of your hiues turned into bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter gaule? Then your wine began to turne into vineger, when you would not receiue Chriſt for your Redeemer, and then all your hony turned into gaule, when you did defame his doctrine and bereaue him of his life. The Synagogue ſtriketh great pity into my heart, to ſee that in time paſt they did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer vnto their God ſacrifices, Holocauſts, and offerings, and afterward gaule and vineger, and dregs, by which curſed and wicked offering, they took away their makers life, &amp; brought their Commonwealth vnto an end.</p>

The Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> vttereth theſe words, ſpeaking in generall of the great tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uails and moſt greiuous thirſt which the ſonne of God ſuffered in particular: and it is as if he would ſay, The great Meſsias waked out of his ſleepe, like vnto a man who had eſcaped out of a lithargy, or ſome drouſie diſeaſe, &amp; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he beheld the ſtate of his ſoule, he found that ſhe was emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For the Prophet to ſay that the ſonne of God ſlept vpon the croſſe, and that after he waked and was weary, and found his heart empty, ſeemeth a ſtrange and a doubtfull thing vnto
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:3666:202"/>pittifull eares. For if it be true that hee ſuffered, how was it poſsible that he ſlept; and if he ſlept, how could it be that he ſuffered? What is more ſtrange vnto torment than ſleepe, and what a greater enemy to ſleepe than torment? Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the ſonne of God hanged vpon the altar of the croſſe, his feet bare, his hands torne, his ſide pierced, his ſinews wreſted, and his bones put out of ioint, how could it bee that he ſhould ſleepe or take any reſt at all? He who ſhould hang vpon the croſſe as Chriſt did, that is, weary, waſted, bloudy, nailed, and one ioint drawn from another, would he not haue greater ability and inclination to complaine, than deſire of ſleepe? The Prophet vttereth foure things in this prophecie, the firſt, that Chriſt did awake out of a ſleepe and dreame which he ſlept, the ſecond, that he awaked aweary, the third, that hee awaked thirſty, the fourth, that hee found his heart empty. Of all theſe foure things, the one doth make vs moſt of all to maruell: for to ſay that Chriſt was aweary I beleeue it, to ſay that he was a thirſt I agree vnto it, and that he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all comfort I do alſo admit. But to ſay that he ſlept, there is that which maketh me to wonder, becauſe his eternall Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did not ſend him thither to ſleepe, but to redeem all the world. It is much to bee noted in this place, that the famous <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth againſt <hi>Manichaeus. Saepè, imo ſaepiſsimè in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cris literis circumſtantiae ſcripturarum declarant Scripturam,</hi> as if he would ſay, It happeneth oftentimes, that when the Scripture is darke and obſcure, that the circumſtances before going and comming after doe declare and explain the ſame Scripture, and one Prophet doth declare another, and one text another. This then being ſo, it is conuenient for vs to find out in Scripture ſome kind of ſleepe, and by that we may coniecture and geſſe at the manner of ſleeping which the ſon of God ſlept vpon the croſſe, and alſo wee ſhall know, when, how, and wherefore Chriſt did awake out of his ſleepe. <hi>Exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatus eſt tanquam dormiens dominus, &amp; tanquam potens crapu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latus vino,</hi> ſayth the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> Pſalm 77. as if he would ſay, Our Lord did awake out of his dreame like a man that is
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:3666:203"/>ſleeping, and hee roſe out of that dreame like a man full of power, and like vnto one who had drunke wine. It is a verefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed truth in our Chriſtian faith, that God is a pure ſpirit, and a ſubſtance not compounded but ſimple, which hath no fleſh which may putrifie, nor bones which may be broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which may cauſe him to eat, nor ſtomack to diſgeſt with, nor vapours to aſcend and prouoke him to ſleepe, nor yeares to make him old. If it bee true that there is no time which can make God old, nor meat which can force him to ſleepe, is it not alſo true, that his ſleepe is otherwiſe to be vnderſtood than ours, and that he awaketh in another manner than we doe? When the Philoſopher ſayth, That ſleep is the image of death, what elſe doth he mean, but that a man which ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, is nothing elſe but an image of a dead man? Mark well the conditions of a dead man, and thou ſhalt find the ſame in one which ſleepeth: for he who is in his bed aſleepe, and hee who is in his graue can neither ſpeake, nor heare, nor vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thoſe which call vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, nor feele thoſe which touch them, nor offend thoſe which abuſe them, nor complaine on thoſe which blaſpheme them, nor reuenge on thoſe which hurt them. Who will not ſay that our Lord dooth not ſleepe this kind of ſleep, ſeeing we ſee that in naughty men he doth diſſemble their ambition, the blaſphemies which they ſpeak, the adulteries which they commit, the inceſts they go about, and the malice which they thinke? What is ſleepe in a man but to haue all his members at reſt? And what elſe is ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in our Lord, but the ſuſpending of his vengeance and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment? The wicked men thinke, that becauſe our Lord doth ſuffer them to liue in the world, and not puniſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that therefore he is aſleep, &amp; that he hath no care ouer the things of this world; which is an errour without all doubt: for they muſt know, if they know it not, that that which wee call in a man ſleeping, is called in God diſſembling. Vpon thoſe words of the Prophet, <hi>Dormitauerunt omnes,</hi> S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſayth, Our Lord doth winke at the naughtineſſe of wicked men, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath a deſire that they ſhould ſinne, but becauſe he
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:3666:203"/>hopeth that they ſhould amend, which if they doe not, the Lord awaketh for their wickednes, and laieth his heauy hand ouer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is our Lord ſeen to awake out of his ſleep but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he laieth his hand ouer the naughty ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; doth chaſtiſe him for his errour? Euen as whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one will giue another a great blow, the higher he doth lift his hand, the greater ſtroke hee doth giue him, in the ſelf ſame ſort, the longer time our Lord doth ſtay and wait for the wicked, the more rigorouſly and with leſſer pity he doth puniſh him. Whereof, thinkeſt thou, doth it proceed, that God doth awake to puniſh thy ſinne, but becauſe he doth ſee thee ſleepe ſo long time in ſinne? <hi>Iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> ſaith, Wilt thou ſee curious reader, that our Lords ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting himſelfe to ſleepe, is nothing elſe but to diſſemble at our faults, and that to awake is nothing elſe in him but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to puniſh thy ſinne; thou maieſt perceiue it by that, that as the Prophet had ſaid, <hi>Excitatus eſt tanquam dormiens,</hi> hee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded immediately, <hi>Etpercuſsit eos in pectora eorum.</hi> What o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing doth the Prophet ſay vnto vs by theſe words, but that at the ſelfe ſame time, houre, and moment, that the Lord did awake out of his ſleepe, he did put his rigorous hand ouer the Princes of the Gentiles. Looke well vnto it, my brother, looke well vnto it, and be not deceiued, and if thou think that our Lord is aſleepe, &amp; hath no regard of thy doings, take thou heed for it is the temptation of the diuell, and that none of the leaſt with the which he doth deceiue the world: for thou wilt one day thinke that the Lord is careleſſe, and hee will ſend ſome grieuous puniſhment vpon thee. And thou art now to vnderſtand, that there are ſo many in thy houſe which will awake him, as thou haſt faults and ſinnes in thy ſoule. In the houſe of our Lord, who is the waker of his clemency, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our amendment, and who is the waker of his iuſtice but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our offence? Vpon thoſe words of the Pſalme, <hi>Ecce non dormitabit,</hi> S. <hi>Barnard</hi> ſayth, As the enemy which dooth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugn Iſrael, <hi>Non aormitabit neque dormiet,</hi> ſo the Lord who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth Iſrael, <hi>Neque dormitabit neque dormiet,</hi> and if it ſeeme that his clemency is aſleepe, when he doth fauour vs, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:3666:204"/>we ſhould liue better, and if it ſeemeth that hee dooth defer his iuſtice, it is becauſe we ſhould amend. What ſhould Iſay more vnto thee, but look what workes thou doeſt, ſuch wakers of God thou haſt. If thou be good, thou doeſt awake him to doe thee good, if thou bee naught, thou doeſt awake him to doe thee hurt: becauſe that in the ſight of our Lord the fault crieth for puniſhment, and goodneſſe asketh reward. Ioining then myſtery vnto myſtery, and Sacrament vnto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, now that wee haue declared how God ſlept in the old Teſtament, it is reaſon that wee declare alſo how his ſon did ſleepe and awake vpon the croſſe, ſeeing that there is no leſſe to be wondered at in the ſleeping of the ſonne, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there was to be ſpoken of in the ſleeping of the Father. For to think that the ſonne of God did ſleepe vpon the croſſe, as one that is weary and in health is woont to doe were a vanity, and alſo an hereſie, for giuing him as they did gaule to eat, and vineger to drinke, there were more reaſon that his ſtomacke ſhould be ready to ouerturne, rather than his head haue any inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſleepe. When <hi>Eſay</hi> ſayth, <hi>Expergefactus laſsus,</hi> hee ſpeaketh nor of materiall ſleepe, but of ſpirituall, and if hee ſay that Chriſt did awake, his powers within him without doubt did not awake, becauſe they were broken with torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts but thoſe powers did awake which lie hidden within him. And although the Apoſtle doe ſay, <hi>Quòd ex ipſo, &amp; in ipſo, &amp; per ipſum ſunt omnia,</hi> to wit, of him, in him, and by him all things are, yet there are ſixe principall things aboue the reſt in him. Theſe ſixe are, his eſſence, his power, his wiſedome, his humane fleſh, his patience, and his clemency, and of theſe ſixe excellences and graces, three of them ſlept, when the ſonne of God ſuffered, and the other three alwaies watched. His pure and diuine eſſence ſlept vpon the croſſe, ſeeing hee did not ſhew himſelfe by it to be an abſolute God, for if hee had ſhewed himſelfe to haue been onely God and not man, he could neuer haue died vpon the croſſe. His high and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall wiſedome ſlept vpon the croſſe in his paſsion, ſeeing that hee neuer anſwered vnto any iniurious word, were it neuer ſo
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:3666:204"/>grieuous againſt him. <hi>Eſichius</hi> ſayth, Chriſt did ſuffer that to be done by him on the croſſe, that a ſheepe doth by himſelfe in the butchery, for if the ſonne of God ſhould haue ſhowne before <hi>Pilate</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> any ſparke of his wiſdome, the Iews had neuer been able to haue put him to death. His inſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and incomparable power did alſo ſleep in his paſsion vpon the croſſe, not reuenging at all on his enemies, for if it would haue pleaſed him to haue vſed it, in leſſe than a moment, hell would haue ſwallowed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all aliue. Now that wee haue told what three powers ſlept with Chriſt on the croſſe, it is alſo conuenient for vs to ſhew what three they were which wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched with him the ſame time. His tender fleſh did not ſleep at the time of his paſsion vpon the croſſe, which was not one moment at eaſe, nor an inſtant without torment. How was it poſsible that Chriſt ſhould not bee but awake on the croſſe, ſeeing that there was no vaine in his holybody which did not bleed, nor no part of his fleſh which was not bruſed, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten blacke and blew? His incomparable patience did watch and not ſleepe vpon the croſſe, the which our bleſſed Ieſus did neuer loſe, ſeeing that he neuer ſpake iniurious word vnto his enemies, nor neuer ſhewed them an angry countenance? <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth, All deuout perſons ought to follow Chriſt in the vertue of ſuffering, for beſides that the vertue of pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is meritotious before God, ſhee is alſo an occaſion of great quietneſſe in mans life. Chriſts diuine and louing cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency did alſo watch, and not ſleep in his paſsion, the vvhich he did ſhew vvhen hee pardoned his enemies, and praied for his malefactors. O infinite goodneſſe, O inſpeakable pitie, O my good Ieſus, for if vve ſhould grant that all the other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues ſhould haue ſlept on the croſſe, yet thy clemency vvould neuer haue giuen ouer vvatching, for it is farre eaſier for the ſonne to loſe his light, than for thee not to forgiue and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Apothegms ſayth, That the Emperor <hi>Titus</hi> on a time gaue a great ſigh and ſaid, <hi>Diem amiſimus ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci,</hi> as if he vvould ſay, It is not reaſon that this day ſhould be
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:3666:205"/>reckoned among the daies of my life, ſeeing that I haue done no good, nor vſed any liberality in it. This ſpeech was ſpread throughout all the world, &amp; much commended of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, and worthy of ſo high a Prince. That which the Emperour <hi>Titus</hi> ſpake of his franckneſſe, Chriſt might farre better haue ſpoken of his infinite clemency, for if the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour did let no day paſſe in the which he did not ſome good, neither did Chriſt let ſlip any houre or moment wherein hee did not pardon ſome offence. And becauſe the Prophet ſaith that the ſonne of God did not onely ſleepe, but alſo that he did awake, let vs now ſee how theſe three powers did awake in Chriſt, and when, and for what cauſe. His incomparable &amp; diuine eſſence did riſe and awake when he ſpake that terrible word at the time that his ſoule was drawne out of him, and therevpon as it were in a traunce and a maze, the great Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion ſaid of Chriſt, That this was the ſon of the true God. Chriſt did alſo awake his high wiſdome vpon the croſſe whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſpake thoſe ſeuen wordes in the laſt houre of his death, in the which there is contained more profound, and deepe ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and knowledge, than is in all humane Philoſophy or knowledge. Chriſt did alſo awake his incomparable power, when hee made the ſunne to be darkened, the earth to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and quake, the graues to open, and the dead to riſe again. Who dooth doubt, but that the ſonne of God doth ſhew in theſe wonderfull meruels, the highneſſe of his power, the depth of his eſſence, and the greatneſſe of his wiſedome, and the valour of his perſon? O my good Ieſus, O the light of my ſoule! how vnlike thou art vnto the children of vanity and lightneſſe, who doe ſhew their eſſence, and yet are nothing; ſhew their power, and yet can doe nothing; ſhew their wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and yet doe know nothing.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Dhue ſitit expergifactus,</hi> ſayth <hi>Eſay</hi> in the place before named, as if hee would ſay, When the redeemer of the world did awake vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the croſſe, hee did awake very drie and thirſty, which was ſo great a thirſt, that it continueth vntill this day: it is moſt certaine that when a man doth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer many griefes at one time, that he ſpeaketh of that which grieueth him moſt, and pointeth with his hand where his greateſt paine lieth. The anguiſhes which Chriſt ſuffered in his mind were innumerable, and the griefes which hee endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his body were intollerable, and that which is moſt of all to be meruelled at is, that his torments being ſo many and ſo ſharpe as they were, yet he complained of none of them on the croſſe, but only of the thirſt which he endured. Saint <hi>Barnard</hi> ſayth, O good Ieſus, O redeemer of my ſoule, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſo many things to complaine on, doeſt thou onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine of thirſt? Thy ſhoulders are naked and whipped, thy hands broken, thy head bleeding, thy fleſh bruſed, and yet doeſt thou complaine on nothing, but of the thirſt which troubleth thee, and of want of water? Doeſt thou complain that thou art thirſty, and not that thou art bloudy? haſt thou not greater want of thy bloud, than of water? Seeing the bloud which runneth from thy head, doth bath thy face, &amp; wet thy tongue, why doeſt thou aske againe for water? For a quarter of an houre that thou haſt to liue, doeſt thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine that thou wanteſt water? O that the thirſt which I ſuffer ſaith Chriſt, is not to drinke wine or water, but to ſee your amendment, and carry you with mee to my glory, for
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:3666:206"/>ſeeing that I am now taking my iourney to heauen. I haue a great thirſt to take my elect with mee. The thirſt which I haue, &amp; the drineſſe which I endure, is not ſo much to drink any liquor, as to redeem you and ſaue you, and reconcile you with my Father, and therefore if thou haue no pitty on mee, yet at the leaſt take ſome on thy ſelfe. O that I had rather, that thou haddeſt ſome pitty on thy ſelfe, than on mee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a greater griefe to ſee thee loſt, than to ſee my ſelf ſuffer. S. <hi>Augustine</hi> ſayth, Thou diddeſt adde vnto all thy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes, this word <hi>Sitio,</hi> ſhewing thereby ſuch a great thirſt, and repreſenting outwardly the exceeding loue that thou diddeſt beare me inwardly, and vnſpeakable charity, which cauſed thee to make but ſmall account of all that thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſuffer in reſpect of that deſire which thou haddeſt to ſuffer. And he ſayth further, O my good Ieſus, I know well that thy thirſt is not for thy ſelfe, but for me, and this thy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh is for no other cauſe, but for the ſaluation of my ſoule: and when thou ſaieſt that thou haſt a deſire to drinke, that is as much to ſay, as to ſuffer more for mee, in ſo much that the care that thou haſt ouer me is ſo great, that by meanes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thou doeſt wholly forget thy ſelfe. What meaneth this O redeemer of my ſoule, what meaneth this? Thy ioints be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing looſed one from another, thy eies broken, thy mother ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing her farewell, and hauing complained on thy Father, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou ſay anew I am a thirſt? What pitty may be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto this, or what goodneſſe equall vnto this Oredee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of my ſoule. Wee ſee by this word <hi>Sitio,</hi> that death was ſufficient to take all thy dolors and griefes from thee, and yet that it was not inough to cut off the loue which thou haddeſt to redeeme vs. Who is able to ſay truly, that thy loue did end vpon the croſſe, conſidering that for the loue of thy elect thou diddeſt yet thirſt after more griefes and anguiſhes? All this Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpake. <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> ſayth, When the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall word ſaid vpon the croſſe, I am a thirſt, I doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that hee did ſo much aske for water to drinke, as hee did aske for time of his Father to ſuffer more griefe and
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:3666:206"/>torment. For as the candle when it is going out doth caſt the greateſt light, ſo Chriſt the more his death drew neere, the more his loue and charity doth kindle towards vs. <hi>Remigius</hi> vpon Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> ſayth, Although the diuine prouidence did reduce all the trauailes of his life vnto three yeares, and that alſo hee brought all the torments of the croſſe vnto three houres, yet it is not to bee beleeued, that Chriſt his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite charity was contented with this ſhort time, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I thinke for my owne part, that the thirſt which hee ſhewed vpon the tree vvas not ſo much to drinke of any wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the riuer, as to declare and make manifeſt his loue vnto the world. <hi>Fulgentius</hi> in a Sermon ſayth, The ſonne of God did thinke, that ſeeing his Father had not giuen him charity by waight, ſo hee ſhould not giue him torment by meaſure, by reaſon whereof hee cried aloud on the croſſe <hi>Sitio,</hi> to let vs vnderſtand by this thirſt, that ſeeing the gifts which hee receiued had no end, that the torments likewiſe which he receiued ſhould not be limitted.</p>

I had ſcarſely ſpoken the word <hi>Sitio,</hi> but they gaue mee gaule to eat, and vineger to drinke. There is much matter to bee ſpoken vpon this, that is, what drinke they gaue him when they gaue it him, where they gaue it him, why they gaue it
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:3666:207"/>him, in what they gaue it him, and how quickly they gaue it him. The drinke which they gaue him was gaule and vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, the place where was vpon the croſſe, the time was when hee was yeelding vp the ghoſt, the cauſe why was to helpe him to die, they gaue it him in a reed and a ſpunge, and that preſently when he had thirſt; ſo that all theſe circumſtances doe aggrauate the fault in them. Wee find that the diuell made two banquets in this world, the one in the terreſtriall paradiſe vnto our Father, where he gaue him the fruit of the tree to eat; the other to Chriſt in the deſert, where he inuited him to ſtones of the field, the which might haue ben ground, ſifted and ſo mingled, that they might haue been eaten. The Iewes gaue Chriſt worſer meat, than the diuell offered him in the deſart, for they gaue him gaule to eat, and vineger to drinke, which are bitter and ſoure, horrible in taſt, and mortal in eating. For as the Philoſopher ſayth, The trueſt loue is the loue of children, the ſmell of ſmels is of bread, the ſauor of ſauors is of ſalt, the ſweeteſt of all ſweetes is of hony, and the bittereſt of all bitters is of gaule. For what is there vnder heauen ſweeter than hony, or more bitter than gaule? For what ſtomacke is there in the world ſo ſtrong, who after a cup of gaule and vineger would not either burſt or die? <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus</hi> vpon S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſayth, If the Iewes had remembred that his Father gaue them freſh water in the deſart to drinke of, and bread from heauen to eat of, and that his ſonne likewiſe gaue fiue thouſand of them fiſh their fill, and bread vntill they left off it, they would not haue giuen him gaule to eat and vineger to drinke. <hi>Damaſcenus</hi> ſayth, That it is proper to naughty men to be very ſparing in matters of vertue, and in matters of vice very lauiſh, which doth eaſily appear in Chriſt, for he asking for nothing but drink, they gaue him alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to eat. <hi>Anſelmus</hi> ſayth, That the abundance of malice, and the want of conſcience made the Iewes put that bitter gaule to Chriſts mouth, which other men do loath to touch. The Iewes did alſo ſhew the depth of their wicked, naughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in giuing Chriſt that horrible drinke, being as hee was
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:3666:207"/>ſo neere death vpon the croſſe, becauſe that all men are wont in that extremity, bee they friends or enemies, to helpe him who is in torment to die well, and no man in that houre dare to trouble or vexe him. <hi>Origen</hi> ſayth, That it is a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome among ſauage and barbarous men, that ſuch as were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies in their life time, doe reconcile themſelues, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don one another in death, Becauſe as <hi>Plato</hi> ſayth, Death a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone doth end all trauaile and all anger. This generall rule failed only in the Iewes, as men which were more barbarous and inhumane than all other, who at the very time that Chriſt was yeelding vp his ſpirit, did ſpet vpon him, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him with their tongues, hated him with their hearts, &amp; tormented him with gaule and vineger. King <hi>Dauid</hi> and king <hi>Saul</hi> were mortal enemies, but when the Philiſtims had ſlain <hi>Saul</hi> in the hils of Gelboe, they ſaw <hi>Dauid</hi> weepe bitterly for him, and cauſed him to bee buried with great care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. All writers doe affirme, that there were not greater e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies in all Greece than <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> the Philoſopher, and <hi>Eſchines</hi> the Orator, but when <hi>Eſchines</hi> vnderſtood in Rhodes that <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> his enemy was dead in Athens, he did not only weepe many teares for him, but did alſo beſtow ſumptuous funerals vpon him. The great hatred and warres which were betwixt <hi>Iulius Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pempeius</hi> the great, are knowne vnto all the world, yet neuertheleſſe when pittifull <hi>Caſar</hi> had <hi>Pompeius</hi> head in his hands, hee ſpake many pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full words in his fauour, and ſhed many teares ouer his head. <hi>Cyrillus</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayth, That there was neuer read of the like hatred as the Iews bare Chriſt, ſeeing that although they ſaw his breath going out of his body, yet they gaue him gaule to eat, and vineger to drinke, becauſe that as they had tormented his outward members with torments, they might alſo poyſon his inward bowels with griefe and paine. S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> ſayth, It is not credible that the wicked Iews had mens hearts in them, but the hearts of ſome madde dogges, ſeeing that the more the ſonne of God did draw neere vnto death, the more they did waxe cruell, becauſe that the end why
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:3666:208"/>they gaue him gaule and vineger, was becauſe hee ſhould die ſooner and alſo raging. If as it did pleaſe Chriſt onely to taſt of that drinke, it had been his will to haue drunke it all, conſidering how there was no bloud left in his vaines, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo his weakeneſſe at that time, it is no doubt but it would haue ſhortened his life, and put him to a more painfull death. O that this doctor ſaid very well, that they had not mens hearts in them, for otherwiſe, conſidering the extremity they ſaw him in, they could not haue done leſſe than haue giuen him ſome wine to drinke, or water to refreſh him, or vſed ſome words of comfort. O pittifull caſe, and vnſpeakable cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, ſeeing that at the houre of thy death, thou haddeſt no friend to encourage thee, no drop of water to refreſh thee, but onely a little gaule for thy breakefaſt, and a little vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to drie thy mouth with. Let not mee vſe then any deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate meates, and let all ſuperfluous diet bee farre from mee, for ſeeing my God and Lord doth neither eat nor drinke but gaule and vineger, from euening to euening, how dare I fare daintely at ſet meales? How dare I looke for death, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a thouſand dainties euery houre, and change a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand meats euery day? Seeing that thou, O my good Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, haddeſt thy mouth poyſoned with gaule, and wet with vineger? O ſacred mouth, O holy tongue, who is ſo wicked, as to dare bath that mouth with gaule and vineger, hauing preached with the ſame ſo many Sermons, giuen ſo many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leſſons, taught ſo many people, and done ſo many mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles? You ſhould put gaule and vineger, O yee curſed Iewes, vpon this my mouth, which is neuer opened but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, and vpon my tongue which can doe nothing but lie, for as for that of your Creator and our Redeemer, what ſinue was there that hee did not tell you of, and what vertue is there that hee did not teach you? Saint <hi>Barnard</hi> ſayth, O what great difference there is betwixt mouth and mouth, tongue and tongue? For mans tongue ſaid vnto <hi>Pilat, cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fige eum,</hi> &amp; Chriſts tongue ſaid vnto his Father, <hi>Neſciunt quid faciunt.</hi> In ſo much, that the peoples whole drift was to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Pilate</hi> to kill him, and Chriſts whole intention was, to
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:3666:208"/>perſuade his Father to forgiue them. <hi>Vbertinus</hi> ſayth, Should not Chriſt haue had better reaſon to haue giuen the people gaule and vineger, ſeeing they accuſed him openly, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they to Chriſt, conſidering that with teares hee did excuſe them? <hi>Quid vltra debui vineae meae quod non feci?</hi> Said Chriſt to the Prophet <hi>Eſaya<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Theſe wordes are deepely to bee conſidered of, ſeeing that by them our Lord dooth call the Synagogue to a reckoning, like vnto one friend which chideth with another, who with intention not to breake off their friendſhip, will trie out where the fault lieth. And to the ſame purpoſe God ſpake by the Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> when hee ſaid, <hi>Iudicium contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham tecum,</hi> as if hee would ſay, I will O Iſraell, that thou and I, and I and thou, ſit down to iudge, and take an arbitrator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt vs, to the end, that both parts being hard, he may iudge what ſmall reaſon thou haſt to offend me, &amp; what great cauſe I haue to complaine on thee. O infinit goodneſſe, O vnſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able clemency of thee my great God, what creature can iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, that thou haſt condemned him without iuſtice, ſeeing thou doeſt firſt ſit downe to verifie thy iuſtice? O vnto how many may God iuſtly ſay at this day, what can I doe more for thee than I haue done, and wherein canſt thou offend me more than thou haſt offended me? O good Ieſus, O light and glory of my ſoule, what ſhouldeſt thou doe more for me than create me, or what couldeſt thou doe more for me than redeeme mee? Thy goodneſſe and my wickednes do ſtriue before thy face, and thy grace and my offence, thy bountie and my vngratefulneſſe, thy mercy and mine obſtinacy, thy pardon and my ſinne: in ſo much, that I neuer ceaſe to ſinne, and thou neuer to diſſemble it. But to ſpeake more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, it is to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered, that our God was not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem all of vs in general, but he did alſo ſatisfie for our ſins in particular, laying vpon himſelf a particular pain which ſhould anſwere vnto our particular offence. Chriſt ſatisfied for the ſinne of pride when hee tooke mans fleſh vpon him, vnto
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:3666:209"/>which humility there can no vertue of any Saint be compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, becauſe he made himſelfe of God a man, of eternall tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, of one that was immortall mortal. <hi>Barnard</hi> ſayth, That of all thoſe which were proud, <hi>Lucifer</hi> was the greateſt, of all gluttons <hi>Adam,</hi> of all Traitors <hi>Iudas,</hi> of all patient men <hi>Iob,</hi> and of all humble men Chriſt exceeded all. Chriſt ſatisfied for fornication by his circumciſion, and therevpon it is, that becauſe the ſinne of lechery is that ſinne, into which men do eaſilieſt and moſt ofteneſt fall into, our Lords pleaſure was to redeeme it with his precious bloud. Chriſt ſatisfied for the ſinne of enuy with his incomparable pouerty, which hee ſo ſtreitly kept, that hee had neither houſe to dwell in, nor a penny to ſpend, nor wealth to liue by. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ſayth, That the end of Chriſts pouerty was, to withdraw from himſelfe things neceſſary, becauſe we ſhould leaue off things ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: for if a Chriſtian haue any thing in his houſe which is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, hee dooth poſſeſſe it all as ſtolne from the poore. Chriſt ſatisfied for gluttony by his continuall faſting all his life time, and oftentimes ſuffering great hunger; which is eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeene, becauſe that after his faſt in the deſart he was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a hungred: and alſo when he and his diſciples did eat eares of corne in the field. S. <hi>Barnard</hi> ſayth, Chriſt had ſuch a great feruour to preach by day, and did contemplate ſo continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by night, that although hee had meat, yet he did ſcarſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to eat it. Chriſt ſatisfied for the ſinne of anger with his continuall patience, which patience of his was ſo perfect that hee neuer knew how to reuenge an iniury, nor neuer vſe towards any man an iniurious word. <hi>In patientia veſtra poſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debilis animaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vectrarum,</hi> ſaid Chriſt to his diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 25. As if hee would ſay, The merit and reward of patience is ſo great that it maketh him vvho hath it, lord ouer his owne ſoule. Many poſſeſſe their eares by not hearing of backbiting, and other poſſeſſe their eies, not ſeeing of vaine things, and others poſſeſſe their hands by keeping them from ſtealing, &amp; others their tongues by keeping them from blaſphemy, but of all theſe which I haue ſpoken off, doth Chriſt ſay that any
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:3666:209"/>of them doth poſſeſſe his ſoule, but only hee who hath pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? What doth it auaile vs to be lords of our feet, hands, and ears, if the diuell do poſſeſſe our ſoules? What is it to be lord and maiſter ouer a mans own ſoule, but wholy to ſubdue his owne ſenſuality? <hi>Ambroſe</hi> vpon S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſayth, He onely hath his will in ſubiection, who in trauaile and vexation hath great patience. Chriſt doth ſay very well, that you ſhall poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe your ſoules in your patience. Seeing that patience is the vertue which dooth confirme friends, reconcile enemies, cut off paſsions, and maketh our he arts mild and gentle. Loe then thou ſeeſt it proued, how the ſon of God was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to redeeme all the world in generall, but that hee did in particular as it were ſatisfie for euery ſinne, disburdening eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man of a particular fault, and caſting vpon himſelfe a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall paine.</p>

Reg. 23. king <hi>Dauid</hi> being in the field of the giants, and fighting with the Philiſtims in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time, and wearied with the heat of the ſunne, and wanting water, gaue a great ſigh, and vttered theſe wordes: O who would giue me now a cup of water of the ceſtern which is neere vnto the gate of Bethleem, where I was wont to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create my ſelfe when I was a young man, and take my fill in drinking of the water. <hi>Dauids</hi> ſigh being heard, and his great deſire of drinking perceiued, three young men which were his ſeruants, determined to arme themſelues, and goe to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelem for water, maugre the enemies, with a reſolution to
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:3666:210"/>bring ſome, or die in the place. And as they had ſworne ſo they did accompliſh it, and going through the enemies camp ſtriking and killing, the end was, that they ſhed more bloud in going, than they brought water in comming againe. In the letter of this figure, there are two things to be noted, that is, that good king <hi>Dauid</hi> did not ſigh, nor deſire ſauerous wine to make him drunk with, but for a pot of water to refreſh himſelf with. Whereof we may take an example, that we may better ouercome our inuiſible enemies with abſtinence than with abundance and plenty. Yet ſo it was, that notwithſtanding the great thirſt which <hi>Dauid</hi> had, hee would not drinke one drop of that water, ſaying that God forbid that hee ſhould drinke of that water which was gotten with the deaths of ſo many men, and was bought with ſo much bloud. Euery man may take an example to himſelfe by this, that no man ſhould carry any thing to his houſe gotten with an euill conſcience, or by the preiudice of another, for we ſee nothing more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon than that men for greedineſſe of another mans doe not onely loſe that which was their own by inheritance, but that alſo which of other mens they had gotten. Leauing the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and comming to the ſpirituall meaning, it doth well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, that Chriſt is the ſonne of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and that <hi>Dauid</hi> is the father of Chriſt, ſeeing the one was thirſty in the field, and the other on the Mount of Caluary, the one ſighting, &amp; the other ſufiering, the one compaſſed with enemies, and the other hanging betweene theeues, the one to drinke a cup of cold water, and the other to redeeme mankind. How farre greater the thirſt was which the ſonne of God had, than that which <hi>Dauid</hi> had, it is eaſily ſeene in that, that <hi>Dauid</hi> did ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his thirſt with words onely, and the ſonne of God with words and teares: wherevpon wee may inferre, that his true thirſt was not ſo much to drinke water of the ceſternes, as to ſaue ſinfull ſoules. O that the thirſt which Chriſt ſuffered was of a farre more higher degree than <hi>Dauids</hi> thirſt, for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> did but ſigh for water, but the ſonne of God did not ſigh but did ſuffer death to redeeme our ſoules, and <hi>Dauid</hi> did
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:3666:210"/>quench his thirſt with the preiudice of other mens bloud, but the ſonne of God did not kil his, but with his own bloud. Chriſt had not ſo good friends on the Mount of Caluary, as <hi>Dauid</hi> had in his campe, becauſe <hi>Dauids</hi> ſeruants brought him water to refreſh him withall, and Chriſts enemies gaue him gaule &amp; vineger to taſt of. <hi>Super vulnera mea addiderunt dolorem,</hi> ſaid the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> ſpeaking in the perſon of Chriſt, as if hee would ſay, The greateſt trauaile and griefe which I feele now is, that beſides the words &amp; dolours which the Iewes gaue me in crucifieng me, ſinners haue now added another dolour vnto my former dolours, which doth grieue me more than all the others did. The dolours which Chriſt ſuffered in his paſsion, his wounds and thornes cauſed them, but the dolour which he now complaineth of, our ſinnes doe cauſe. And he hath great reaſon to complaine more of this than of the others, becauſe the wounds which they gaue him and the nailes and thornes which tormented him dured but one day, but the griefe which our offences doe cauſe in him doe euery houre offend him. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth, If there were no fault in vs, there ſhould be no wounds in Chriſt, and therevpon it riſeth, that wee wound him more in his entrails with our offences, than the Iewes did with their nailes. But ſome man may ſay that Chriſt dooth not ſo much complaine by the Prophet of his wounds, as of a grief and dolour which they added aboue all dolours, and therefore it is conuenient that we declare what this dolor is, and how farre it reacheth. For the better vnderſtanding of this point we muſt note, that ouer and aboue all the ſinnes which we commit we doe adde a new one vnto them, which is as it were a counterpeiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt euery ſinne, the which cauſeth the ſinne to bee more grieuous and leſſer hope of amendment in vs. What is this new ſinne but the pleaſure which we take to haue ſinned, &amp; the deſire which we haue to ſinne againe? And becauſe wee may not ſeeme to ſpeake at randome, wee will giue of euery one an example. If the prowd man would be content to bee prowd only, it would be but halfe a fault, but alaſſe hee ſayth
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:3666:211"/>that he is nothing prowd at all, if wee regard his great deſart, by reaſon whereof he deſireth to be of greater power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and ability to beſtow more than hee doth. If the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and impatient man would be content to chide onely, to braue it, and murmure, it might paſſe; but alas hee doth adde fault vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a fault, that is, he hath a very great thirſt &amp; a deſire to iniury and moleſt his enemies, take their liues from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; alſo to ranſacke and ſpoile their goods. If the couetous man could be content with that which were neceſſary, and with ſomewhat more, it were tollerable; but alaſſe, like a noughty Chriſtian he heapeth ſinne vpon ſinne, for beſides that hee is not content to ſaue bread and drinke, yet hee neuer ceafeth day nor night to hoord vp all hee can. If the carnall man would bee content once to attaine his deſire, and that which his ſenſuality requireth, it might be diſſembled; but alaſle hee hath ſuch a great thirſt to enioy all hee ſeeth, that if it were in his power, he would leaue no virgine vndefloured, no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried woman not diffamed, nor any widdow not deceiued. If the ſlothfull man would bee content himſelfe not to goe in the cold in the Winter, nor into the head in Summer, but would eat without any labour of his owne, and ſleepe in his bed without care, we would not much care if he did it; but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſe, hee hath ſuch a great deſire of eaſe, and is ſuch an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to labour, that hee deſireth nothing, but that his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſhould take paine, becauſe hee might eat, and that all they ſhould watch becauſe hee might ſleepe. If the glutton would be content to eat till he were fill, and ſometimes vntill hee belked, wee would not ſo much regard it; but alaſſe hee hath ſuch a great deſire to eat daily of exquiſite meats, and drinke wines of great price, that if it were poſsible, there ſhould bee no fiſh in the ſea which hee would not eat of, nor no meat on earth which he would not taſt. Loe then this is the dolour which Chriſt complaineth on, when he ſayth, <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vulnera mea addiderunt dolore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> which did ſo much grieue him that he felt none more, for Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> ſayth, That God doth not looke what we be, but what we deſire to bee.
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:3666:211"/>What greater wickedneſſe, or what greater naughtineſſe can there be in the world than not to be content to be naught, but to deſire to be more naught. <hi>Caſsiodorus</hi> ſayth, That the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences which wee commit are the wounds which wee giue Chriſt, and the dolour which we adde vnto theſe wounds, is the deſire which we haue to ſinne more and more. This cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed deſire and wicked thirſt of adding ſinne vnto ſinne, is alſo paied for and ſatisfied for the iuſt which come vnto our Lord when he ſaid aloud on the croſſe, that he had a deſire to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer more, as the wicked had to ſinne more. O infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, O vnſpeakable cleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy, who had euer ſo great a thirſt to enioy our ſinnes, as thou my good Ieſus haddeſt to ſuffer torment? Who vntill this day had euer a deſire to become worſer and worſer, but our Lord had a greater deſire to make him better and better? Who had euer a greater thirſt to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his vices, than Chriſt had to make vs very vertuous? O my ſoule, O my heart, doe you not ſee that your thirſt of ſinning more and more is cured with his thirſt of ſuffering, and that your thirſt of heaping one ſinne vpon another, is quenched by Chriſts thirſt of adding one pain vnto another? <hi>Quod facis fac citius,</hi> ſaid Chriſt to <hi>Iudas</hi> in the night of the laſt ſupper, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13, as if he would ſay, Seeing that thou waſt ſo ſhameleſſe as to ſell me yeſterday, and art determined to deliuer mee this night vnto my enemies, make an end of thy ſupper and riſe from thence, and doe that which thou wilt doe quickly, becauſe that the end of thy perdition ſhall bee the beginning of my redemption. O ſorrowfull ſpeech, O heauy word which Chriſt ſpake vnto the vnhappy diſciple, becauſe that thereby he is permitted to doe what he would, as though he ſhould giue him licence vtterly to deſtroy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and that there ſhould bee no hope of his amendment. What other meaning had thoſe wordes which our holy mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſpake vnto the reprobate diſciple, that is, Do that which thou haſt to doe with ſpeed; but to declare by thoſe words, that he had forſaken him, and that hee will defend him no more with his holy hand? and yet in this lamentable ſpeech,
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:3666:212"/>Chriſt vſed great clemency toward <hi>Iudas,</hi> for when hee ſaid, Doe ſpeedily that which thou wilt do; it was to ſay, deliuer me quickly, and die thou quickly: for how much the older thou doeſt grow in yeares, by ſo much the more thou wilt grow in offences. God of his mercy keep vs from this licence or permiſsion, for it is a great ſigne that this man is already foreſeene to be damned, whome our Lord doth permit to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne to be naught preſently. Our Lord doth neuer giue this licence to a Chriſtian religious ſoule, but when the fleſh doth moue him, or ſenſuality diſquiet him, he taketh away the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of falling, and giues him new deſires to ſtrengthen him with. Woe be vnto him vnto whome our Lord ſayth as he did to <hi>Iudas, Quod facis fac cito,</hi> that is, that hee may doe that which ſenſuality doth lead him vnto, &amp; accompliſh that which the diuell perſuadeth, for the greateſt malediction that God doth put vpon any man, is, to ſuffer to put that in execution which ſenſuality requireth. <hi>Remigius</hi> ſayth, That the diuell is ſo great a friend vnto his friends, and hath ſo great care of pleaſing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they haue no ſooner thought of a ſinne, but he doth preſently lay open the way to commit it. <hi>Damaſcen</hi> ſayth alſo, That when a man deſireth to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer than he is, the diuell is by and by ſo buſie, that he doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that which did diſagree, and ioine that vvhich was farre aſunder, openeth that which vvas ſhut, lighteneth that which vvas darke, maketh that eaſie vvhich vvas moſt hard, and giueth that, that vvas not to be hoped for. This being true, as true it is, vvhat vvill not a naughty man doe, vvhat vvill hee not venter on, yea and vvhat vvill hee not attaine vnto, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſo good a tutor and helpe as the diuell? If a good man vvould doe any good vvorke, hee findeth a thouſand ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blockes to hinder him: and contrariwiſe, if a naughty man vvill commit any naughty fact, hee ſhall find as many helpes for the performance of it, and the reaſon is, becauſe our Lord doth ſeeme to forget his, becauſe they ſhould merit the more, but the diuell doth alwaies fauour his, becauſe he vvill incite them to ſinne. Wee haue ſpoken all this, by reaſon of
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:3666:212"/>the gaule and vineger vvhich the Iewes gaue Chriſt, for it is a vvonder to thinke vvith vvhat ſpeed they ſought it out, &amp; vvhat diligence they vſed in giuing him it, for ſurely if the Scripture did not aſſure vs of it, it would ſeeme but a dreame to ſay that they ſhould haue all thinges ſo readily &amp; at hand as they gaue him. Is it not a thing much to be vvondered at, that the Iewes being out of the towne, and in open field, as ſoone as he had ſaid <hi>Sitio,</hi> that they ſhould preſently haue at that place, ſoure vineger, bitter mirrhe, poiſoned gaule, vnſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uory iſope, and a ſpunge to drinke it in, and a reed to reach it him? If a man ſhould haue gone into the towne to ſeeke all theſe ſixe things, hee would haue been ſixe houres a getting them: For he muſt haue gone to the butchery for the gaule, to the Apothecary for the mirrhe, to another place for the vineger, to a ſhop for the ſpunge, to a garden for Iſope, and to the riuer for a reed. But vvhen Chriſt ſaid vpon the croſſe, I am a thirſt, they did not ſtay ſixe houres to ſeek theſe things, but they did reach them him preſently all at once, kept, and hidden ready for him: for if his ſoule vvould not haue forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him vvith the torment of the nailes, ſhee vvould haue forſaken him by the force of that drinke.</p>
               <p>The ſame leaue that Chriſt gaue <hi>Iudas,</hi> it ſeemeth that he gaue it alſo vnto the Iewes, that is, that they ſhould doe by him vvhat they vvould, and how they vvould, and as ſpeedily as they vvould, vvhich liberty they vſed vvith the aduantage, ſeeing that in ſhort ſpace they vvatched him with their eies, dogged him vvith their feet, laid hold on him with their hands, blaſphemed him vvith their tongues, hated him vvith their hearts, and ended his life vvith their drinkes. The naughty Iewes vvent to the Mount of Caluary, and there vvent alſo old <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Nichodemus,</hi> but their intentions were farre different the one from the other, the holy men carried pinſers vvith them to pull out the nailes, ladders to take him downe from the croſſe, ointments to annoint him vvith, a ſheet to wind him in, and a ſhrowd to bury him in. <hi>Non ſic, impij non ſic,</hi> The wicked did not go ſo, but to go their
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:3666:213"/>ſtacions on good Friday, and meditate on the Mount of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uary, they carried vnder their clokes in one pot the vineger, in another bladder the gaule, in a boxe the mirrhe, &amp; in a cloth the Iſope, in one hand the ſpunge, &amp; in another the reed. Tel me I pray thee, what inward minds theſe wicked Iewes had, ſeeing they did ſhew ſuch outward ſhewes of their pilgrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Of theſe bitter trauails and vnſauoury liquors, we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther certaine leſſons, worthy to be knowne, and profitable to be kept in memory. We muſt aboue al things take heed that we doe not offer vnto our Lord any liquor which is not pure, cleare, and cleane, or mixed, for here vpon earth men refuſe mixed liquors, becauſe they doe corrupt the ſtomacke. <hi>Cibus ſimplex est vtiliſsimus homini, compoſitus aute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pernicioſus,</hi> ſayth <hi>Pliny,</hi> as if hee would ſay, The body is beſt maintained with vncompound meats, becauſe that compound meats are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous for the body. The like condition is to bee obſerued in the ſoule, the which doth deteſt diſſembled manners, &amp; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre doubling in conditions, for being as ſhe is a moſt ſimple iuſtice, ſhe cannot endure to bee furred with malice. <hi>Hilarius</hi> ſayth, I will ſay that he doth offer vnto Chriſt, his vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding mingled with vineger, who occupieth his thought more on another tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God: I wil ſay that he doth offer his memory mixed with mirrhe, who troubleth his memory with nothing but how he may lead his life without diſquietneſſe: I will ſay that hee doth offer his will mingled with gaule, who forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his creature and ſerueth worldly things: hee dooth offer his heart vnto Chriſt mingled with bitter Iſope, who at the ſame time will liue at eaſe, and yet ſerue our Lord: &amp; he doth offer vnto Chriſt a good worke put vpon a reed, who dooth it for no other end but for vaineglory: and he offereth Chriſt his life ſoken with a ſpunge, who doth all that he doth of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie. Finally, we ſay that thoſe do offer vnto Chriſt drinks of bitterneſſe, who in beliefe are Chriſtians, and in workes Pagans.</p>

The catholicke church may hold her ſelfe very happie and rich, ſeeing that God hath promiſed her abundance of waters cleare and cleane, flowing from the fountaine of her Sauior and Redeemer.

<pb n="422" facs="tcp:3666:214"/>meaneth this O good Ieſus, what meaneth this? Haſt thou not one drop of water for thy ſelfe to drinke of, and yet doeſt thou inuite all the world to drinke of thy fountaines? It doth wel appeare O my good Ieſus, that thou haſt all that good for me, and keepeſt all trauailes vnto thy ſelfe, ſeeing that of thy ſweet water thou doeſt inuite all men to drinke, but the gaule and vineger thou doeſt giue no man to taſt. What are the fountaines that thou wouldeſt haue vs drinke of, but thy holy wounds with the which we were redeemed? O ſacred fountains, O holy wounds, which are ſo delectable to behold, and ſo ſweet to taſt, that the Angels are deſirous to drinke of them, and all creatures are willing to bath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. They are fountains which alwaies flow, they are waters which alwaies run, &amp; what do they flow but bloud &amp; water, &amp; whither do they flow but to the Catholick church?

O good Ieſus, O holy fountaine, from whence but from the fountaine of thy bowels did the water flow to waſh our ſpots, and from whence but from thy precious vaines did the bloud runne to redeeme our offences? It is gathered in ſcripture, that the waters of Raſim were moſt ſwift, the waters of Iorda. troubled, the waters of Bethleem were pooles and ſtanding, the waters of Marath were bitter, the waters of Siloe were ſoure: The waters of thy wounds O my Redeemer, are not of theſe qualities, for they are ſafe to ſaile in, cleane to behold, ſweet to taſt, and profitable to keepe.

What man is there this day in the world ſo noble in birth, or ſo rich in wealth, but if he proclaime publickely, that hee will burne both man and woman, but they wil preſently lay hands on him, &amp; bind him hand &amp; foot, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demn him for want of diſcretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?

Vpon thoſe wordes, <hi>Non veni mittere pacem ſed gladium,</hi> S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth, If wee will well vnderſtand, that which Chriſt ſayth in this place, we ſhould not only not bee ſcandalized at it, but alſo highly thanke him for it: for to ſay the truth, with that fire he doth ſeare our dead fleſh, and with that knife he doth let out our corrupt bloud. <hi>Beda</hi> vpon the Apoſtle ſayth. What is the ſire which Chriſt brought from heauen into the world but his exceeding great loue?
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:3666:215"/>The quality of this high fire is, to heat and not burne, to giue light and not hurt, to burne and not conſume, to putrifie and not waſt, to warme and not to grieue. O good Ieſus, and light of my ſoule, what ſenſuality can ouercome mee, or what ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation can throw mee downe, if at the coales of thy fire I warme my ſelfe, and giue my ſelfe light with the flame of thy loue? What can hee doe, what is in him, or what regard is there of him in this life, who doth not warme himſelfe at the fire of thy loue? What made S. <hi>Andrew</hi> goe cheerfully and ſinging to be crucified, but the fire of the loue which burned in him? What made S. <hi>Agnes</hi> goe more ioifully to martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome than a new married ſpouſe to bed, but the fire of thy diuine loue which ſhined in her? What made thoſe ſtones ſeeme vnto S. <hi>Steuen</hi> hony comoes, but that holy loue which burned in his ſoule? <hi>Iguis erat &amp; calefaciebat ſe.</hi> O vvhat a difference there is betwixt the fire which Chriſt brought downe from heauen, and the fire which <hi>Cayphas</hi> hath in his pallace. For S. <hi>Peter</hi> warming himſelfe at it, of a Chriſtian became a Pagan, &amp; S. <hi>Paule</hi> warming himſelf at Chriſts fire, of a Pagan became a Chriſtian. God ſend me of Chriſts fire, ſeeing it doth make me know him, and God keep <hi>Cayphas</hi> fire from me, ſeeing it doth make me denie him. For if S. <hi>Peter</hi> had not warmed himſelfe at <hi>Cayphas</hi> fire, the wench would not haue importuned him, nor he denied Chriſt, not haue loſt the confeſsion of the catholicke faith. The Euangeliſt ſayth that, <hi>Petrus calefaciebat ſe,</hi> that is, That <hi>Peter</hi> did warm him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe at the fire, but he ſayth not that the fire was able to take his cold from him, and therefore the fire which the world hath for her worldlings is ſuch, that they are but few vvhich warme themſelues at it, but many which waxe cold by it. S. <hi>Peter</hi> being from the fire ſaid vnto Chriſt, <hi>Tecum paraui iam in mortem me,</hi> and by the fire he ſaid, <hi>Non noui heminem,</hi> in ſo much that being at ſupper with Chriſt he did burne, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Cayphas</hi> fire he was a cold. The ſonne of God then ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there was not below in the world heat which could recreate, nor fire which could burne, nor light vvhich could
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:3666:215"/>comfort, nor flame which could giue light, nor any thing which might content, he brought from heauen with him the fire of his holy loue, with the which wee ſhould all be enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, all lightened, and all contented. The ſon of God would neuer haue ſaid, I came to put fire on earth, if hee had ſeene that there had been the true fire of his loue vpon the earth, but ſeeing that the fire of the world doth burn and not heat, hurt and giue no light, waſt and not burne, grieue and not cheere, burn and not purifie, ſmoke and not ſhine, he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred to bring a fire which ſhould heat all the world. Woe be vnto him which will not warme himſelfe at this fire, and woe be to him who will not receiue light at the flames of his loue, becauſe that the only perfection of our ſaluation dooth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in offering our ſelues to God, and in louing him with all our heart. It is much to be noted, that Chriſt brought at one time fire to burn, &amp; a ſword to cut me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s throats, ſeeing he ſaith, <hi>Ignem veni mittere in terram,</hi> and alſo, <hi>Non veni pacem mittere ſed gladium,</hi> to let vs vnderſtand, that hee brought fire with him, with the which his elect ſhould ſerue him with loue, &amp; a ſword of the which the imperfect ſhould haue feare. Hee burneth with liuely flames who ſerueth God with loue: and his throat is cut who ſerueth God with feare, and not vvith loue. Whereupon it is, that in the arke of <hi>Noe</hi> there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny little roomes, and in the houſe of God many dwelling pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo alſo in the Catholicke church there are diuers maners of ſeruing of God, he doth ſerue God much better who ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him with loue, than he who followeth him for feare: but in fine ſo as we doe not offend our Lord, be it with loue, or be it with feare, let vs alwaies ſerue him. He is happy who ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his throat to be cut with the knife of feare, but he is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry happy who goeth to warme himſelfe at the fire of his loue: for the feare may be ſo great, that he may erre in that which he taketh in hand, but he who loueth him much cannot erre in that which he doth. According vnto <hi>Ouid,</hi> he cannot erre who loueth a good thing, nor there can bee no errour where there is perfect loue. <hi>Cyrillus</hi> ſayth, If the Synagogue did
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:3666:216"/>highly eſteeme of the ſword with the which <hi>Dauid</hi> did cut the Giant <hi>Golias</hi> throat, wee which bee Chriſtians ought much more to eſteeme of the fire of loue with the which Chriſt did redeeme vs, becauſe it was his loue onely which gaue vs the hope of his glory, and ouer our death the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>Leo</hi> ſayth in a Sermon, If they aske the ſonne of God what he brought from heauen, hee will ſay loue; if they aske him what Art he knoweth, he will ſay loue, if they aske him what he is, he will ſay diuine loue, if they aske him what hee would haue vs to doe for him, hee will ſay nothing but loue him. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſayth, O what great difference there is betwixt the ſeruing of God, and ſeruing of the world; for the world would haue vs ſerue him with our perſon, flatter him with our tong, giue him of our wealth, and alſo venter for him our ſoules: but the ſonne of God is farre from asking any of theſe things of vs, for he ſeeketh no more of vs, but that wee anſwere the loue which he dooth beare vs, and be gratefull for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites which he doth beſtow vpon vs. <hi>Si obtuleris primitias fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gum tuarum domino de ſpicis adhuc virentibus torrebis eas ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui.</hi> God ſpake theſe vvorder vnto <hi>Moiſes,</hi> and then comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Moyſes</hi> to proclaime them before all the people, as if he vvould ſay, When the Summer ſhall come, and the harueſt draw neere, if the eares of the firſt fruits vvhich they offer vnto God ſhould be greene and not drie, ſee thou drie them firſt in the fire, before that thou offer them in the temple. <hi>Iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus</hi> ſayth, The giuer of the law to commaund that they ſhould offer the firſt fruits of all their harneſtes, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them that they ſhould not offer them vp greene but drie, and to command that they ſhould not bee dried in the ſunne but at the fire, and that they ſhould be throughly dried but not burned, the Scripture would neuer haue ſet downe this ſo particularly, vnleſſe there had been ſome my ſtery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained vnder it. <hi>Origen</hi> vpon Exod. ſaith, That becauſe in holy writ there is no blot to ſcrapeout, nor no letter to be added, we muſt ſo interpret that which God ſpeaketh, &amp; that which the law ordaineth, that without wreſting of the letter vvee may
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:3666:216"/>apply it vnto our learning. What other thing is it to offer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God the firſt fruits of our corn, but to preſent before him al our deſires? who dare begin any heroical work vvho doth not firſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſult vvith God, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend it vnto him? vnles they had firſt craued the fauour of the God <hi>Iupiter,</hi> the Gentiles durſt not ſo much as vvrite a letter: &amp; dareſt thou which art a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, not asking for Gods grace, enterpriſe any thing? he ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his firſt fruits fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, vvho taketh any thing in hand, &amp; not reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend himſelfe vnto God, &amp; he paieth his firſt fruits vnto our Lord, vvho vvithout his holy grace beginneth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for it is hee only vvho vvill guide our works in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, &amp; he vvho vvill direct the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to our profit. <hi>Chriſoſtom</hi> ſaith vpon S. <hi>Luke,</hi> for God to ask the firſt fruits of that vvhich vve cut in the field, is to ask of vs that vvee loue him vvith all our hearts: for that vvhich is not begun vnder him, and in his holy name vvill end afterward by the hands of the diuel. He doth pay our Lord his firſt fruits, vvho vvhen hee riſeth out of his bed doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend himſelfe vnto our Lord, &amp; offer vnto him all that vvhich he vvill doe that day, and he ſtealeth his firſt fruits from our Lord, vvho neither careth for to ſerue God, nor to ſay any one praier, but as ſoone as hee riſeth beginneth to lie and couſin. He paieth our Lords firſt fruits, vvho of four and twenty houres vvhich are in the day, beſtovveth one in thinking vpon him, and hee ſtealeth from God the firſt fruits, vvho hath neither regard of his ſoule, nor thinketh vpon God at any houre. It is alſo to bee vveighed, that our Lord is not contented vvith his firſt fruits of greene corne vnleſſe it bee offered vp dried at the fire, to giue vs knovvledge, that all that vvee doe is nothing vvorth, if vve doe not vvarme our ſelues at the fire of his loue. What is all that vvorth vvhich I doe, or vvhat am I vvorth vvhich doe it, if I doe it not for God? Hee doth offer vp all his eares of his corne dried, who dooth all his vvorkes for God, and hee doth offer them greene, who doth them not but only for men, vvhom vvee do aſſure, that for thoſe God will neuer pay, nor yet men be thankfull.
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:3666:217"/>What other thing bee the greene eares and not ripe, but all our weake and humane actions? Greene, and hard, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſoned are all our workes, and therefore wee haue need of the heat of fire to drie them, becauſe God dooth neuer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that which is offered, if he who doth offer it bee not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. He offereth vnto our Lord greene eares, who hath no patience in trauels: for as the value of gold is knowne in the goldſmithes melting pot, ſo is a good Chriſtian known in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation. Hee is a greene Chriſtian who doth interprete the Goſpell according vnto his owne will, and he is a very green religious man who ſtriueth againſt his ſuperiour: becauſe that the true ſeruant of our Lord ſhould haue no will of his owne, nor deſire authority, nor dare to poſſeſſe any thing proper. Then we will ſay that the eare is drie, when it goeth eaſily out of the ſtraw: then we will ſay that a man is perfect, when he is weaned from all couetous and worldly things. Thou art very greene my brother, if with thy humility there bee min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled any ambition, with thy charity any enuy, with thy po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerty any couetouſneſſe, with thy chaſtity any wantonneſſe, and with thy honeſty any hipocriſie, by reaſon whereof thou muſt draw neere vnto the heauenly fire, vntill thou haſt caſt this dreame from thee. It is a great ſign that the block which lieth ſmoking in the ſire, is not throughly drie, and the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon which yet taſteth of the world, is not well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in religion; becauſe the true ſeruant of our Lord hath his heart as dead to the world for Chriſts ſake, as a mans body is dead which lieth buried in the graue.</p>

That all is now accompliſhed and made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſeeing the redemption of the world is ended, &amp; the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of the Synagogue fulfilled. If we looke curiouſly vnto it, we ſhall find theſe words true, <hi>Conſummatum est,</hi> and few in number, but yet the myſteries encloſed in them very many, becauſe wee are aſſured by thoſe words by his holy mouth, that we are pardoned of the eternall Father, that is, that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction is now ended, and that wee are now by his precious ſonne redeemed. Being a rule of the Philoſopher, <hi>Quod omnia quae fiunt fiunt propter finem.</hi> If Chriſt had not ſpoken theſe

But ſeeing the ſonne of God ſaid <hi>Conſummatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> est,</hi> we may ſtand vpon a ſure ground, that there is neither any workes of our redemption vnaccompliſhed, nor any one tittle of Scripture not fulfilled. O what a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort it is to humane nature, that Chriſt had ſaid, <hi>Conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſt,</hi> by his owne holy mouth. For <hi>Dauid, Ieremy, Eſay, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel, Ezechiel,</hi> durſt neuer ſay, that ſinne was at an end, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that it ſhould haue an end in the time of the Meſsias; the which as it was by them prophecied, ſo it was by Chriſt ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled. <hi>Septuaginta hebdomedae abbreuiatae ſunt ſuper populum tuum &amp; ſuper vrbem ſanctam tuam vt conſummatur preuari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio, &amp;c,</hi> The Angell <hi>Gabriell</hi> ſpake theſe words to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Daniel,</hi> chap. 9. as if hee ſhould ſay, Seuenty weekes hence, which ſhall bee accompliſhed foure hundred and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and twenty yeares hence, the holy of all holies ſhall be annointed, iuſtice ſhall bee perfect, noughtineſſe ſhall bee blotted out, and ſinne ended. Compare thou now, O curious reader, the prophecy of <hi>Finem accipiet peccatum,</hi> with <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummatum eſt,</hi> which Chriſt ſpake, and thou ſhalt plainely ſee how it is ſaid only of the ſonne of God, that he ſhal redeeme vs, and how hee doth aſſure vs that hee hath already redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vs. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſayth. Who was able to ſay that ſinne is at an end, but only hee who died to end ſinne? It is here to bee noted what is ſaid, who ſpeaketh it, where hee ſpeaketh it, and in what meeting he ſpake it, and for what myſtery hee ſpake it. That which is ſpoken is, <hi>Conſummatum eſt,</hi> hee who ſpake it is Chriſt, the place where, is the croſſe, the time was euen as he was yeelding vp the ghoſt, the cauſe why, was for the comfort of all his church: for of al the ſeuen words which Chriſt ſpake vpon the croſſe, there is none which maketh ſo much for our purpoſe, as <hi>Conſummutum est.</hi> In the firſt word which was. Father forgiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what intereſt had the church in it, ſeeing that Chriſt ſpake it onely for the pardon of the
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:3666:218"/>Synagogue? In the ſecond, which was, Lord remember mee; what had the church in it, ſeeing it was ſpoken by the theefe which ſuffered by Chriſt? In the third which was, Behold thy mother; what part hath the church therein, ſeeing hee ſpake it onely vnto the diſciple which was there preſent, and to his mother which wept by him? In the fourth, which was, Why haſt thou forſaken me; what hath the church therein, ſeeing he ſpeaketh only vnto his Father, and complaineth of his Father vnto his Father? In the fift, which is, I am a thirſt; what part hath the church therein, ſeeing that thereby hee dooth ſhew the exceeding great thirſt which hee ſuſtaineth for the torments which hee ſuffereth? In the ſeuenth vvord which is, Into thy hands O Lord I commend my ſpirit; what part hath the church therein, ſeeing the ſonne goeth out of the world, and commendeth his ſpirit vnto his Father? If we haue any part of all the ſeuen vvordes, it is in <hi>Conſummatum eſt,</hi> in giuing vs knowledge by his owne mouth of the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and end of the old lavv, and of our full redemption, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſpake then vnto vs only, and forthe end of all our ſins, vvhich vvere at one time redeemed euen as Chriſt did end his life, and gaue vp his bleſſed ghoſt. O profound myſtery, O vnſpeakable ſecret, and neuer heard of before, in <hi>Conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum est,</hi> ſeeing that it is nothing elſe to ſay <hi>Conſummatum eſt,</hi> but to giue notice vnto all the vvorld, that the church is novv begun, and the Synagogue caſt dovvne, the Scripture fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, &amp; his life ended. His precious bloud is ended, the vvhich is ſo dravvne out, that there remained no one drop in his vaines, for hee came vvith a determination into the vvorld, fully to accompliſh all the loue vvhich hee bare vs, and to ſhed for vs all the bloud vvhich hee poſſeſſed. That is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated vvhich I came into the vvorld for, and my fathers commandement is alſo accompliſhed for vvhom I came into the vvorld, to manifeſt his holy name: for ſo I haue done: and if I came to lighten the vvorld &amp; to preach, I haue prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and giuen it light. The greife of my body is ended, the torments of my members, the perſecutions of my enemies,
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:3666:219"/>the wearineſſe of my bones, the multitude of my trauels are all at an end. All that which the Prophecies prophecied, all that which the Patriarkes ſignified, all that which the holy men deſired, and all that which our Fathers craued of God, is finiſhed and conſummate. The riches of the Temple, the highneſſe of the kingdome, the rigour of the law, the pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Preiſthood, and the honour of the people is at an end. The hatred of the Iewes, the enuy of the Phariſies, the hypocriſie of the Saduces, the malice of the Scribes, is fully at an end. What was euer ſeen that Chriſt began, which he brought not in the end to full perfection? Wee are thoſe which doe hardly begin any good thing, and if we doe begin it, ſcarſe bring it to the middle, and if wee bring it to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle we neuer end it. The ſonne of God is he only who begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all thinges when he will, continueth them as he ought, and finiſheth them as he luſteth. When Chriſt went to Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem to ſuffer, he ſaid vnto his diſciples. <hi>Ecce aſcendimus Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſolimam, &amp; conſummabuntur omnia quae ſcripta ſunt de me,</hi> and when he praied ouer the ſupper, he ſaid, <hi>Opus conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui quod dedisti mihi,</hi> and on the altar of the croſſe, he ſaid alſo, <hi>Conſummatum eſt,</hi> giuing vs to vnderſtand by that ſpeech, that like vnto a man hee doth giue that which he is commanded, pay that which he doth owe, and accompliſh that which he doth promiſe. S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſayth, Much greater, O my good Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, much greater is the taking of the torments, which thou haſt endured, than the waſting of the grace which wee haue loſt; and farre greater is thy paine than our fault, and thy offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring than our offence: and therefore thou doeſt ſay, <hi>Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum eſt,</hi> becauſe that now the fault of the ſeruant is ended with the death of the ſonne. <hi>Anſelmus</hi> ſayth, O how truly thou doeſt ſay, O my good Ieſus, <hi>Conſummatum eſt,</hi> for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thy eies broken as thou haſt, thy ſhoulders opened, thy hands pierſed, and the world redeemed, what doth there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine to end, ſeeing that thou art at an end. <hi>Damaſcen</hi> ſayth, When vpon the croſſe, the ſonne of God ſayth, <hi>Conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum est,</hi> If he would haue vſed the rigour of his iuſtice, as he
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:3666:219"/>did vſe his accuſtomed clemency, had it thinke you haue been much, that all the world ſhould haue ended with him, ſeeing the Lord ended and died there which did create it. <hi>Remigius</hi> ſayth, O bill of paiment, O precious money, O ſure account, O acquittance of God, which thou doeſt giue vs, O good Ieſus, when thou doeſt ſay, <hi>Conſummatum eſt,</hi> ſeeing that thou doeſt aſſure vs by that ſpeech, that the bond &amp; obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the deuil had ouer our humane nature is payd by thee, and cancelled and blotted our, and alſo caſt into duſt &amp; aſhes. Fiue thouſand yeares and more we were bound to hell, and ſubiect vnto the deuill, but the ſonne of God going to the croſſe to die, he vnbound vs from the ſeruice of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and as he went by little and little towards his end, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation went wearing away, in ſo much that with this ſpeech <hi>Conſummatum est,</hi> the ſoule went out of his body, and ſinne tooke his end in vs. O high Lord, O great redeemer, when thou ſaieſt, <hi>Conſummatum eſt,</hi> what is that which doth not end, ſeeing that thy life doth end? Gods humane life dooth end, death to hell, ſinne to the world, idolatry to gentility, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies to the law, and figures to the Scripture. Pope <hi>Leo</hi> ſayth, by this word <hi>Conſummatum eſt,</hi> was ended, the reproch of the croſſe, the baniſhment from heauen, the power of the diuell, the treaſon of the diſciple, the denying of <hi>Peter,</hi> the ſentence of <hi>Pilate,</hi> the indignation of the people, the life of the ſonne, and the comfort of the mother. O comfortleſſe mother, O virgine borne without the like, what griefe did thy ſorrowfull heart feele, when thou heardeſt thy ſonne ſay that his life was ended, thou continuing as thou didſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thy ſonne? What meaneth this O good Ieſus, what mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth this? With this ſpeech <hi>Conſummatum eſt,</hi> the paine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to thoſe which languiſhed in deſiring thee, the offence of the wicked ceaſeth, the bloud of thy vaines drieth vp, and yet doe not the teares of thy mothers eies end? With this ſpeech of <hi>Conſummatum eſt,</hi> All is finiſhed, doſt thou drie the teares of thoſe which haue offended thee their fill, and doſt thou make no reckoning of thy bleſſed mother, who vnto the
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:3666:220"/>croſſe hath followed thee? If vnder that ſpeech doe enter all whome thou haſt created, why doeſt thou leaue out thy mother of whom thou waſt borne? Moſt bleſſed mother of God certainly is not left out, becauſe that here on the croſſe is finiſhed and accompliſhed the quietneſſe of her heart, the light of her eies, the contentment of her entrails, the end of her deſires, the reſt of her will, the life of her ſoule, and the hope of her glory.</p>

This is another kind of banquet than that which the Emperour <hi>Vitellius</hi> made to certaine Embaſſadors of Perſia, of which <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſayth,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:3666:220"/>That if they had bound themſelues to giue them another dinner like vnto their ſupper, hee doubteth whether all the treaſure of Rome would haue ſufficed to haue done it. This is another banquet than that of <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> and <hi>Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patra,</hi> wherein he and ſhee did ſpend ſo many precious ſtones beaten into pouder, and ſuch a great ſumme of riches, that in the opinion of writers, another Aſia might haue ben bought with it. This was another kind of banquet than that which king <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> made to the nobles of his kingdome, in the which for the ſpace of an hundred and fourſcore daies, there was neither ſtint in eating, nor meaſure in drinking. By theſe examples it is manifeſt that prophane men doe inuite like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to prophane men, and vertuous &amp; good men like vnto ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous men. Such a one ſeemeth to bee this good man <hi>Booz,</hi> who going in the field, and reaping in ſummer time, doth not entreat any to breakfaſt but to dinner, and hath nothing to eat but a ſlice of bread dipped in vineger. And this good la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer <hi>Booz</hi> the better to ſhew his temperancy, and his great abſtinency, did not ſay vnto <hi>Ruth</hi> that ſhe ſhould wet all the bread in the vineger, but a ſlice only, the which being hard, he bid her rather wet it to make it ſoft, than that ſhee ſhould haue any great dainty of it. The holy Scripture reciteth this ſtory for the praiſe of thoſe which are paſt, and confuſion of thoſe which are preſent, I meane of thoſe which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh of, whoſe God is their belly, who rather follow <hi>Epicure</hi> in eating, than Chriſt in liuing. Of all the vices which mans nature is ſubiect vnto, there is none that groweth ſo faſt as gluttony, becauſe that in times paſt all men did keepe ſuch a meane in eating, and ſobriety in drinking, that there was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermuch meat, and ſearſity of eaters, but alaſſe now a daies there are ſtore of eaters, and want of meats. <hi>Vidi monſtrum a natura, hominem bis ſaturum in die,</hi> ſaid <hi>Plato</hi> when hee retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from Scicilie vnto Aſia, as if he ſhould ſay, The thing which maketh me moſt of all to wonder at in Scicilia, is that I ſaw a man a monſter in nature, becauſe hee filled his belly twiſe euery day in eating. O if <hi>Plato</hi> ſhould come in this our
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:3666:221"/>time, how much more would hee bee ſcandalized at vs then he was to ſee <hi>Dennis</hi> the Tyrant fill his belly twiſe a day, for intemperate men are not content now adaies to dine and ſup, vnleſſe they haue alſo their breakfaſt and drinking. Let thoſe take example of <hi>Booz</hi> who will giue good example, who did not inuite <hi>Ruth</hi> to breakfaſt &amp; drinking, but to dinner, ſeeing that he ſayth, <hi>Veni huc hora veſcendi,</hi> becauſe that the ſeruant of our Lord ſhould not eat when ſenſuality doth craue it, but when reaſon requireth it. <hi>Booz</hi> did not entreat his welbelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Ruth</hi> to dainty diſhes or to precious wines, but only vnto a peece of hard bread moiſtened in vineger; becauſe that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate eating and diſordinate drinking dooth deſtroy the memory, dull the vnderſtanding, vvaſt the naturall heat, ſtop the ſtomacke, vveaken the feeling, diſable the perſon, offend the conſcience, &amp; conſume a mans goods and ſubſtance.

The letter left a ſide, and comming to the ſence, wee haue thought good to bring in the figure of vineger, to ſearch out the reaſon and cauſe why the ſonne of God tooke vineger for the laſt tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his martyrdome, and vvhy in hauing end to taſt of it, hee gaue vp the ghoſt. <hi>Repleuit me amaritudinibus &amp; inebria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit me abſynthio,</hi> The Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſpake theſe vvordes in his Lamentations, in the name of the redeemer of the vvorld, as if it were in complaining of the Synagogue, and ſayth, In paiment of the great benefits which I haue done thee O my Synagogue, thou haſt filled me with bitternes, &amp; made mee drunke with the iuice of wormewood. If there ſhould be no myſtery contained vnder theſe words, the text would ſeem to be contrary to it ſelfe, for if his body be full of bitternes, how could her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tain any more iuice of wormwood, and if he could receiue more, how then was hee full? For the
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:3666:221"/>vnderſtanding of this, you muſt vnderſtand that as Chriſt was more than an Angell, ſo he had more innocency than an Angell; and as he was more than a Prophet, ſo he had more knowledge than a Prophet; &amp; as he was more than a prince, ſo hee had more power than a Prince; and as hee was more than a ſaint, ſo he had more perfection in him than ſaints; and alſo becauſe he was a greater Martyr than all other Martirs, he did ſuffer more martyrdome than any other Martyr. <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen</hi> vpon <hi>Iob</hi> ſayth, That by reaſon that the ſonne of God was more than man, becauſe he was both God and man, hee knew more than a man, he could doe more than a man, hee did more than a man, he ſuffered more than a man, and endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red more than any man; for the griefs which paſſed through his heart, and the torments which his members ſuffered, what tongue is able to rehearſe them, how much more what body is able to ſuffer them? Euery martyr may ſay with <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> He hath filled me with bitternes; becauſe they were tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with ſo many torments: but the ſonne of God onely can ſay, And he hath made me drunk with abſynth: that is to wit, ouer &amp; beſides that he ſuffered all that other martirs did ſuffer, he did ſuffer another new kind of martyrdome, which did exceed all other martyrdomes of man. All the holy and choſen men of our Lord haue drunk a thouſand draughts of very bitter martyrdome, but the ſon of God only did drinke Abſynth, becauſe there was no heauineſſe which did not poſſeſſe his heart, nor no dolour which did not oppreſſe his members. Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſayth, All the words which Chriſt ſpake we may beleeue, but all the excellent workes that hee did, we be not able to imitate; becauſe that beſides the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtrength which bodies are wont to haue, he tooke more to bee able to ſuffer thoſe torments, for the fleſh of the ſonne of God was ſo tender and delicate of it ſelfe, that if he ſhould not haue added force vnto his owne force, and ſtrength vnto his owne ſtrength, it could not haue been but he ſhould haue died very yong, or elſe neuer haue been able to haue ſuffered ſo high a martyrdome. What was Chriſts meaning then, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="438" facs="tcp:3666:222"/>he ſaid <hi>Inebriauit me abſynthio,</hi> But that hee onely drunke that drinke of abſynth, ſeeing that hee alone did ſuffer more torments than all the Martyrs. Chriſt is not contented to ſay, that hee drunke much of that drinke, but that hee drunke it all, to let vs thereby vnderſtand, that as no man can be drunk but with pure wine, ſo the ſonne of God was he who ſuffered pure martyrdome without any eaſe at all. No man euer drank of pure martyrdome as Chriſt did, for all other martyrs, if they ſuffered in ſome of their members, they did not in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and if they ſuffered in body, they ſuffered not in ſpirit, and if they ſuffered in ſpirit, they had ſome comfort in it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the comfort which God gaue them was grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the martyrdome which they ſuffered. Vpon thoſe words of the Pſalme, <hi>Extraneus ſum fratribus meis, Baſil</hi> ſaith, Chriſt was a ſtranger and ſeperated from his brothers, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther martyrs his companions, becauſe that in his bitter paſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hee was leſſe comforted and more tormented than any of them. Like vnto a man ouerloaden with reproach and infamy, and full of torment, Chriſt ſaid vpon the croſſe, <hi>Deus, Deus, meus quare me dereliquisti?</hi> The which complaint he would neuer haue vſed, if his father had comforted him as hee did other Martyrs. Speaking the more particularly, Chriſt in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting gaule and vineger, ſaid immediately <hi>Conſummatum eſt,</hi> to let vs thereby vnderſtand, that in that bitter drink was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the cure of the ſweet taſt which <hi>Adam</hi> had in eating the apple. The figure doth very well anſwere vnto the thing figured, and the hurt vnto the remedy, in that, that as that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in by the mouth in which <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned, ſo by Chriſts mouth entered in the remedie of that ſin; &amp; as ſin began in a ſweet apple, ſo it ſhould end in ſoure vineger. Hard by the wood <hi>Adam</hi> committed the offence, &amp; on the wood Chriſt redeemed the ſinne; in ſweetneſſe our hurt began, and in bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe began our good and remedy. <hi>Adam</hi> in eating of that which liked him died, and Chriſt taſting of that which was bitter gaue vp his ghoſt. Becauſe the truth ſhould anſwere vnto the figure, the ſpirit vnto the letter, and the ſecret vnto
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:3666:222"/>the myſtery, &amp; the fault to the pain, the ſon of Gods pleaſure was, that his laſt torment ſhould bee with ſharpe vineger, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that with that drinke ſhould bee cured the grieuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our ſinne. <hi>Ad anunciandum manſuet is miſit me, vt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tritis corde, &amp; predicarem captiuis indulgentia &amp; clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis aperſionem, Eſay,</hi> 61. Theſe are the wordes of the redeemer of the world ſpoken by the mouth of the Prophet <hi>Eſayas,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring by them his meaning why he came from heauen into the world, ſaying, The cauſe why I came into the world, was to preach vnto the meeke, to cure the diſeaſed, to tell cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues that they ſhould be deliuered, and denounce to all that are bound that they ſhall be now looſed. The redeemer of the world reciteth foure cauſes why he came into the world; that is, to preach vnto the good, to cure the diſeaſed, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem captiues, and looſe priſoners. Theſe foure things are ſo high to be enterpriſed, and ſo hard to be atchieued, that none but Chriſt in the world was able to do it. It may be, that ſome man be able to preach, but he cannot cure, and if he can cure infirmities, yet he is not of power to redeem captiues, &amp; if he be of power to redeem captiues, yet hee hath no authority to let go priſoners: inſomuch that there is no man in the world ſo valerous, but doth want the performance of one of theſe four things, only the ſon of God hath all, ſeeth all, vnderſtandeth all, knoweth all, and can do all. And therevpon it happeneth, that man doth not performe that which hee taketh in hand, becauſe he cannot, but Chriſt not becauſe he cannot, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he wil not. <hi>Eſaias</hi> ſaith, That Chriſt came firſt to preach to the humble &amp; meeke, &amp; not to the prowd, to let vs therby vnderſtand, that the meek &amp; gentle would beleeue him, and the prowd and fooliſh mocke at his life and doctrine. Hee ſayth ſecondly, that he came to cure and heale him who had his heart broken, and not thoſe who had no repentance of their naughtines, to let vs therby vnderſtand, that the ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his precious bloud ſhould haue no vertue nor efficacy in thoſe which neuer ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, but in ſuch as of their wickednes do repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Thirdly he ſaith, that Chriſt came into the world to redeem captiues out of captiuity: wherin thou ſaiſt moſt truly
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:3666:223"/>O my good Ieſus, becauſe there was no ſinne in the world which thou diddeſt not pay for, nor no ſinner whome thou diddeſt not redeeme. Fourthly, he ſaith, that Chriſt came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world to deliuer priſoners out of gaole, and looſe them out of priſon: wherein he ſayth alſo moſt truly, for he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer all men from the thraldome of the diuell, and redeeme ſinners who were captiues. O glorious incarnation, O bleſſed co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming, O happy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ourney that that was which Chriſt made from heauen to the earth, ſeeing the exerciſes wherein hee occupied himſelfe, and the office which he tooke vpon him were ſuch, that the Angels knew not how to do them, nor all the men in the world vndertake them. Vpon theſe words, <hi>Vt mederer corde contritis,</hi> S. <hi>Augustine</hi> ſayth, <hi>Magnus venit medicus, quia magnus vbique iacebat egrotus,</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, agreeable to the words of <hi>Eſayas,</hi> There came from high heauen a very great Phiſition, becauſe that in euery corner of the earth there lay a ſick body. What Phiſition was there euer in the world who brought ſuch medicines as Chriſt did, or kept ſuch an order in curing vs? the order which Phiſitians preſcribe, is, that firſt they ordain a diet for the patient, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate the humours, then they procure him ſome ſweat to expell ventoſities, then they let him bloud to correct the matter, and then they giue him a purgation to rid and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty him of all that is ſuperfluous and hurtfull in him. The Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian doth all this, giuing a receit in a paper, and ſending it to the Apothecary, and miniſtring it to the patient; in ſo much that the Phiſitions cure is in the pulſe which he doth handle, and receit which hee ordaineth. When good Ieſus ſayth by <hi>Eſayas, Veni vt mederer contritis corda,</hi> although he obſerued this order in curing the diſeaſed, yet he obſerued it not in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring his medicins. For the ſwearing bleeding, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, which the diſeaſed ſhould haue receiued, our benigne Ieſus tooke vpon him when hee was in health. Doeſt thou not thinke that he kept a diet, when he did faſt not only forty daies, but conſidering that all his holy life was a longer diet? Doeſt thou not thinke that hee ſweat all our ſinnes, when
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:3666:223"/>in his agony in the garden his bloud did run by all his pores? Doeſt thou not thinke that he bled all the corruption of our ſinnes, when hee did ſcarce leaue a drop of bloud in all his vaines? Doeſt thou not thinke that he purged the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and perdition of all the world, when he tooke the purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of gaule and ſoure vineger? Not without a high myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry then, and a profound Sacrament, hee ſaid vpon the croſſe, <hi>Conſummatum eſt,</hi> as he ended to take that purgation, giuing vs thereby to vnderſtand, that the diſeaſed man was purged, let bloud, ſweat, and was healed, and that there was nothing elſe to be done in him, if he did not fall againe by fault.</p>

The Apoſtle ſpeaketh theſe wordes, talking with the Iewes of the high perfections which were in Chriſt, as if he ſhould ſay, This ſonne of God which I preach vnto you, was very perfect in himſelf, and was cauſe that all ſuch as did beleeue in him, ſhould attaine to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting life and ſaluation by him. There are ſome which be neither good to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues nor vnto others; and there are ſome which be good to others, and not good to themſelues; and there are other who are good to themſelues and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and of theſe the ſonne of God was, ſeeing the Apoſtle ſayth, That he was <hi>Conſummatus,</hi> to wit, that the ſonne of God is good in all perfection, and to all good men very profitable. Vnder theſe few words the Apoſtle comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth many graue ſentences, that is, he will call vs to memory
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:3666:224"/>who the ſon of God is, &amp; therefore he ſaith, <hi>Quod conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus factus est,</hi> &amp; alſo what profite we receiue by his comming, and therefore hee ſaith, <hi>Quod fuit cauſa ſalutis aeterna.</hi> Theſe two things are not of ſuch ſmall quality, but that vnder them all the holy ſcriptures are comprehended. For hauing ſaid what Chriſt is, and what he hath done in the world, there is nothing more to bee ſought for in all the Goſpell. Becauſe Chriſt did ſay on the croſſe <hi>Conſummaetum eſt,</hi> and becauſe the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paule</hi> doth ſay of Chriſt, <hi>Conſummatum factus eſt,</hi> it is conuenient for vs to turne againe to theſe words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we may ſee in them how great Chriſts omnipotency is, vnto the which no poore creature is able to reach vnto. To ſpeake of the greatneſſe and omnipotency of God, is to goe about to take the heauens with our hands, or meaſure the earth by handy breads, or the ſea by ounces. <hi>Cum inceperit ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra tunc finiet,</hi> ſaid the wiſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as if he would ſay, The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God is ſo high to reach vnto, ſo inſcrutable to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, ſo inuiſible to ſee, ſo omnipotent to comprehend, that when we think that we are come to an end of vnderſtanding it, then we are but at the beginning of ſearching it. <hi>Holket</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe words ſayth, What would the wiſe man ſay, [that when we ſhould make an end, then we ſhould begin] but that if we will ſpeake of the greatneſſe of God, either that we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer begin to magnifie it, or neuer end to praiſe it. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in his fourth booke <hi>De Trinitate,</hi> ſayth, The cauſe why the myſteries of God doe make all the world afeard is, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is one, but <hi>Trinus,</hi> and that he is one the Iew is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily conuinced, and the Moore alſo to beleeue it, but that God is <hi>Trinus</hi> and one, as he is, none doth beleeue it but the Chriſtian. And he ſayth further, that which God doth make vs wonder at in his diuinity, Chriſt doth in his humanity, for if he had but one thing alone in him, we ſhould dare to ſpeak of his greatneſſe, but hauing three things in him which are, diuinity, fleſh, and ſoule, and that all three are brought &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to one diuine perſon, the vnderſtanding will be aweary to thinke of it, &amp; the tongue dumbe to rehearſe it. <hi>Omnia fecit
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:3666:224"/>deus in numero pondere, &amp; menſura,</hi> ſayth the wiſe man, as if he ſhould ſay, Our Lord is ſo certaine in all that he doth, and ſo wary in all that hee taketh in hand, that bee they neuer ſo many he numbreth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, be they neuer ſo great hee weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them, and be they neuer ſo broad he meaſureth them, ſo that in the houſe of God there is number, weight, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. The moſt ſacred humanity of the ſon of God commeth not vnder this reckoning, for being as it is vnited vnto the word, it is ſo perfect and adorned with ſuch high merit, that there is no number to count it, nor wait to weigh it, nor yet yard to meaſure it. As concerning the firſt, Chriſts humanity wanteth this which we haue ſaid of number, ſeeing he is but one perſon, and according to the Philoſopher, no vnity is a number, but the beginning of number. Vpon thoſe words of the Prophet, <hi>Tu ſolus cog nouiſti nouiſsima &amp; antiqua,</hi> S. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſayth, Alone and not accompanied with any, the ſon of God is vnited to the word, and in his holy gouernance no man ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with him, nor no man doth beare him company in that high principality; for as in that he is God, he hath being by his owne proper production, ſo in that, that hee is man hee is firſt created, and of all things created, he is the beginning of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Vpon thoſe words, <hi>Omnia per ipſum facta ſunt, Irenaeus</hi> ſayth, Euen as all things were made by Chriſt, in that that he was God, ſo they were made by him in that that he was man, becauſe he was the firſt thing which God inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded in the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, to create all things for him, as vnto him who ſhould be heire of all: by reaſon whereof we owe vnto the ſon of God, not only our rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption, but alſo our creation; for if it had not been by him, and for him, God would haue created nothing: for the means being taken away, the end was alſo taken away. Touching the ſecond, the humanity of the word wanteth weight, &amp; he cannot be weighed, for all the Saints being put in one balance, and the ſonne of God in another, it would bee that, that a drop of water is in reſpect of all the water which is in the world. Who is hee which can be weighed with Chriſt, or bee compared with the leaſt of his merits?
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:3666:225"/>If before his ſight the heauens be not cleane, how dare any ſaints be weighed with him? Concerning the third, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of the word cannot bee meaſured, becauſe that the grace which was giuen to him alone was ſo much, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heauen, nor in earth there is found any meaſure for it. How can there bee found any meaſure in the ſonne of God, ſeeing that it is hee with the which is meaſured all humane and Angelicall nature? Wee may gather of that which wee haue ſaid, that ſeeing Chriſt hath remoued from himſelfe, number, weight, and meaſure, yet that it is a folly and a raſhneſſe to thinke to find an end in his greatneſſe. We ſpeak all this, becauſe that conſidering that there is two natures in Chriſt, one diuine, and the other humane, wee will not talke immediately of his diuine eſſence, but of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, as it is compared to the diuine, and ſo wee ſhall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſomewhat of Chriſt, although we cannot comprehend all that doth belong vnto him. <hi>Suſcepit de manu demini dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> ſayth the Prophet <hi>Eſayas,</hi> chap. 40. ſpeaking of that which the eternall Father had giuen his only ſonne, as if hee ſhould ſay, All other creatures receiued ſingle fauours, and only the ſon of God receiued them double, for all other beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe were nothing but bare men, but he was man and God, &amp; God and man. <hi>Duplicia ſuſcepit de manu domini,</hi> becauſe hee was more than that which he ſeemed to bee, and hee was more than that which was hidden, becauſe his diuinitie was hid, and his humanity did appeare, and to his diuinity was v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited his humanity. He receiued two gifts of our Lord, ſeeing that vnder that earth is hidden a precious pearle, and vnder that rough couering is encloſed the heauenly cloath of gold. He receiued double fauour at our Lords hands, ſeeing that vnder the penitent weed we ſhall find the great king of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuy, and vnder thoſe dead skins, wee ſhall find the good Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarke <hi>Iacob</hi> aliue. He receiued two things at our Lords ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, for if wee take away the couering, wee ſhall ſee all the diuine eſſence, and if we breake the vaile of the Temple, wee ſhall know the heigth and the pureſt part of the heauen. He recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:3666:225"/>two ſingularities of our Lord, ſeeing hee alone and no other is at one time a traueller and at his iournies end, at one time with the ſuperior portion enioieth, and with the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or ſuffereth. He receiued two gifts, ſeeing it was giuen to him and to no other, to be paſsible and impaſsible, viſible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, mortall and immortall, temporall and eternall. <hi>Suſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit de manu domini duplicia,</hi> ſeeing it was giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto him alone to be the end of the vnhappy Synagogue, and the beginning of the catholicke church, and to be him who doth inflict pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment vpon the bad, and giueth glory vnto the good. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold then how Chriſts humanity is a perfect image &amp; a high reſemblance, ſuch as is not to be found neither in heauen nor vpon earth, becauſe it is made to the liuely likeneſſe of God, and becauſe it is alwaies like his mould and type which is the Word. <hi>Hilarius</hi> in his ſecond book of the Trinity ſaith, Euen as a glorious body vnited vnto a glorious ſoule, is as it were ſpirituall, and hath ſpirituall conditions, ſo the humanity of the diuine word being vnited vnto God, hath the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and qualities, as he vnto whom he is vnited. <hi>Damaſcen</hi> in his ſentences ſayth, As it was commaunded that all ſhould be giuen to the noble dame <hi>Iudith</hi> which did belong to <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lofernes,</hi> ſeeing that ſhe had ouercome him, ſo vnto the man Chriſt it was giuen and attributed, that all that ſhould be ſaid of him, which was ſaid of the Word, ſeeing that hee did alſo ouercome the diuell. And becauſe wee may the better ſee what conformity there is betwixt the humanity and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinity, we wil ſpeak one word vpon euery word of that which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> did put in the beginning of his holy Goſpell, ſpeaking of the eternall Word. In the beginning was the Word, ſayth S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſpeaking of the eternal generatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the ſon of God. Wherein he giueth vs to vnderſtand, that that eternall word hath his being by the firſt internall emanation of the Father, ſeeing that hee proceedeth of him by the way of vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, which is the firſt emanation, and before the will, ſeeing it is preſuppoſed. That which we ſay of the diuinity, we may alſo ſay of the humanity, ſeeing that it was in the beginning
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:3666:226"/>of God, by an Hypoſtaticall vnion in the word, and by an excellency of perfection aboue all that which God created. And the word was with God, ſaith alſo S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, Becauſe thou maieſt ſee that the perſon of the Father is not the perſon of the ſonne, nor the perſon of the ſonne the perſon of the Father, if I haue ſaid, that In the beginning was the word, I ſay now that neere vnto God was the ſame word, in ſo much that that which is neere vnto mee is without all doubt diſtinguiſhed from me. The humanity is ſo neere vnto the diuinity, that it is one perſon with it, and thereupon it is, that as in the Father and in the ſonne there is but one eſſence although they be two perſons, ſo in the word of God, and in the humanity of Chriſt, although there bee two natures, there is but one perſon; and this diuine, and not humane. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith further, And God was the Word, which may alſo be ſaid of the humanity well vnderſtood, as of the diuinity, by the high communication of diuine and humane qualities which are in Chriſt, becauſe there are many things in Chriſt by grace, which are in God by nature. Vpon thoſe words. <hi>In quo habitat omnis plenitudo diuinitatis,</hi> S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſayth, The diuinity of the word doth dwell ſo perfectly in the humanity of Chriſt, that becauſe that is ſo neerely vnited and deified which is contained, it taketh the name of that which contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it: and hee ſayth further, <hi>Quod factum eſt in ipſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> vita erat.</hi> The which hee ſpeaketh, becauſe that being (as he is God) the fountaine of all life, and that of his onely will dooth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed all life, it is certaine that all that ſhould be in him ſhould be life. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayth, As all things in God ſhall be called life, becauſe they are accompanied and ioined in him, ſo in his holy humanity, all things are life, becauſe there are vnited in him all the goodneſſe of glory and grace. As all that which is made in the word is life, &amp; al that which is out of it is death, ſo all that which is wrought in Chriſt for his honour and glory is life, and all that which is not done in him and by him is all death. S. <hi>Iohn</hi> goeth forward and ſayth, And the life was the light of men, which he ſpeaketh for the
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:3666:226"/>light of reaſon, which hee did imprint in the ſoules, which were blind by ſinne, the which blindneſſe was remedied with the light of the humanity of Chriſt, the which although it do not ſhine like vnto the moſt ſimple diuine light, yet it was ſufficient to lighten all humane nature: and hee addeth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, That the light doth ſhine in darkeneſſe, <hi>Et tenebrae eum non comprehenderunt,</hi> which words may be no leſſe verified of the humanity of Chriſt than of the diuinity of the word. <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larius</hi> vpon thoſe words ſayth, In reſpect of the diuine clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe all other creatures may bee called darkeneſſe, becauſe it is impoſsible that the diuine ſhould not alwaies ſhine, but the humane hath euery houre need of light. God doth ſhine in the darkeneſſe of our ſinnes, ſeeing that none but hee can forgiue them: and in this point it is no other thing to ſay, <hi>Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae eum non comprehenderunt,</hi> but that his moſt great mercy cannot be made empty. S. <hi>Barnard</hi> in a Sermon ſayth, God is mighty in forgiuing ſinnes, but he is moſt mighty in forgiuing thoſe which are often committed, wherein is ſhewed his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite mercy, ſeeing that he is not comprehended by them, nor limited in pardoning them, but hee doth pardon them when he will, how he will, and vnto whom he will. In that that hee is man, Chriſt hath alſo darkeneſſe where he may ſhine, that is to wit, all pure creatures be they neuer ſo holy and choſen, ſeeing that of themſelues they haue no light at all, if they doe not receiue it of the ſonne of God. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ſayth, The perfection and light of Chriſt is ſo great, that being compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto that which other Saints haue, it ſeemeth that it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them ſomewhat vnperfect, which is to bee vnderſtood, not becauſe there is any want in them, but becauſe there is a great abundance of excellency. <hi>Irenaus</hi> in a Sermon ſayth, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God tooke from the ſpirit of <hi>Moyſes</hi> to giue vnto thoſe elders which ſhould be iudges with him, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>Moyſes</hi> continued wiſer than they: ſo it is in Chriſt, from whom how much grace ſo euer the holy men doe take, or haue taken, yet they did neuer draw his grace drie, nor at any time compared themſelues with him. We haue vſed all
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:3666:227"/>this long diſcourſe to prooue how well the Apoſtle ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>Quod Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſummatus factus eſt,</hi> ſeeing that by theſe words it doth appeare, that he had all perfections in him, and by his <hi>Conſummatus eſt,</hi> which he ſpake vpon the croſſe, that all our wickedneſſe is now finiſhed and at an end.</p>

<pb n="449" facs="tcp:3666:227"/>finiſhed in all perfection in the ſeuenth yeare. There were alwaies buſied in the working of that temple a hundred fiftie and three thouſand and ſixe hundred workmen, and all this in time of peace, for otherwiſe in time of warre, it might haue been that ſome ſhould haue builded, and others defended. Of this great number of workmen, foureſcore thouſand brought ſtones out of the mountaines, and ſeuen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y thouſand carried burdens on their ſhoulders, and the three thouſand and ſixe hundred were as it were ouerſeers and commanders: The vaſſales of the king of Tyrus are not comprehe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this number, who did cut wood on the Mount Lybanus, and yet they were many in number, as it may appeare in that <hi>Salomon</hi> did ſend them at one time twenty thouſand load of corne, and twenty thouſand of barley, and twenty thouſand quintales of oile, and forty thouſand meaſures of wine. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are there included in this number the Marriners which brought timber, nor the engrauers which engraued images, nor the goldſmithes which wrought in ſiluer, which were a great number, ſeeing that the metall which they wrought was much. The Scripture maketh no mention of the ſiluer that was ſpent there, but he ſayth only that there was ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of it in <hi>Salomone</hi> houſe, as there are ſtones on the earth. What ſhall wee ſay of the gold that was ſpent there, which would ſeeme incredible to all the world? Before that king <hi>Dauid</hi> died, he left three thouſand meaſures of gold for the building of the Temple, which hee offered of his owne, and not of that which he had taken in warre. All the nobles of the Realme did offer alſo for the building of that holy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difice fiue thouſand meaſures of gold, beſides others mettals of lattin, copper, and tinne, whereof there is no waight laid downe, becauſe the quantity of it exceedeth number. What riches was ſpent there may bee eaſily gathered in that, that the Temple was all couered with gold from the top vnto the bottome, &amp; that not of plain gold like a painted table, but cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly cut &amp; kerned. In this prowd building, this word gilding is ſildome vſed, but this word clad with gold, and enterlaced
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:3666:228"/>with gold, and couered with gold is oft ſpoken, and therefore that which <hi>Salomon</hi> did of pure gold, is more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now adaies is wont to bee gilded. The Gloſſe ſayth, That the floore of the greateſt place, which they called <hi>Sancta,</hi> and the floore of the leſſer, which they called <hi>Sancta ſanctorum,</hi> were both pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with fine gold, and all this for the reuerence of the arke, whereby ſo much the more euery thing was more precious, by how much the neerer it was vnto it. For the ſeruice of this Temple there were appointed twenty and foure thouſand Prieſts, of the great tribe of <hi>Leui,</hi> whoſe charge was to panch the beaſts, offer ſacrifice, light the lampes, and kindle the fire. For to keepe the gates of the Temple, there were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed foure thouſand porters, and for to ſing the Pſalmes which <hi>Dauid</hi> made, and thoſe which <hi>Salomon</hi> made, there were choſen other foure thouſand, whoſe office was alſo to play on inſtruments of muſicke. If the building which <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> made was prowd and ſtately, ſo was alſo the firſt ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which he offered, for he killed and offered vnto our Lord on one day twenty and two thouſand beefes, and a hundred and twenty thouſand ſheepe. Now that wee haue ſpoken of the pompe, glory, and riches of that famous temple, wee will tell you in what all this great treaſure did end, and thereby it may be perceiued how vaine and brittle all worldly glory is, and eſpecially that which is founded vpon riches. It is a thing much to be wondred at, and worthely to be noted, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Sancta</hi> was not rich, and when the great citie of Ieruſalem was poore, with their pouerty they did ouercome all their enemies, and afterward with their wealth they were ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by them. <hi>Dauid</hi> was poorer than <hi>Salomon,</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> was poorer than <hi>Dauid,</hi> and yet for all their pouerty they had more victories ouer their enemies then <hi>Salomon</hi> and <hi>Roboam</hi> his ſonne in their times, whoſe riches &amp; treaſures did exceed the treaſures of their predeceſſors. Men thinke that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt miſery &amp; pouerty, doth conſiſt in getting much wealth and riches, and in hauing abundance of all things; the which thing to thinke is a great vanity, and a dangerous thing
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:3666:228"/>to get, for we ſee many, who thinking to bring wealth and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to their houſe, bring death, war, and diſſention to it: and becauſe we may not ſeeke far for examples, let vs looke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Iewes with their treaſures, and if wee weigh the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter well, we ſhall find for a truth that miſery &amp; pouerty is not remedied with riches, and that the captain of miſery is peace, and the companion of riches is miſery. No longer after the death of <hi>Salomon</hi> but fiue yeares, <hi>Seſach</hi> king of Aegypt did ſend to Ieruſalem ſeuenty thouſand horſemen, and twiſe as many footmen, and a thouſand two hundred Wagons for ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, and took Ieruſalem and robbed the Temple, and ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led king <hi>Roboams</hi> pallace: inſomuch that the Temple was not ſo long a ſacking as it was a building. The king of Babilon did ſend his army to Iudea, who vſed the matter ſo well, that hee tooke the city, and robbed the Temple, and led the king of Iudea priſoner to Babilonia, and no man was able to reſiſt him or hurt him. After this great miſchiefe came the king of the Chaldeans, who killed the yong men, tooke the women captiue, ſet fire on their towres, burnt the ſanctuary, &amp; tooke the people priſoners, and robbed the treaſure. The warres which the Aegyptians, Chaldeans, and Babilonians had with the Hebrews, were not becauſe they did hold them for their enemies, but only to rob their treaſures: nſomuch that againſt the poore Iſraelites made greater warres their owne riches, than all other barbarous nations. Let the litterall concluſion be, that wee may ſay truly of the Temple of <hi>Salomon, Quod Conſummatum eſt,</hi> ſeeing that the Temple is at an end, <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> which made it, the people where it was made, the riches with the which it was made, and the ſacrifices for the which it was made. Of all this we may gather, that God dooth not giue vs riches, becauſe we ſhould loue them, but becauſe wee ſhould benefite our ſelues by them, &amp; ſerue him with them: but alaſſe that which God doth giue vs to ſerue him withal, we doe turne to our owne pleaſures and delights. <hi>Dominus in templo ſancto ſuo, dominus in caelo ſedes eius,</hi> ſayth the Pſal. 10. as if he would ſay, The places where our Lord doth moſt of
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:3666:229"/>all abide are in the heauens vvhere he hath his ſeat, and in the holy Temple where he hath his dwelling place. Becauſe we ſhould not thinke that the Temple vvhich he here ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of is the Temple of <hi>Salomon</hi> in Ieruſalem, or of <hi>Dian.</hi> in Antiochia, or of <hi>Pantheus</hi> in Rome. God ſaid not that hee dwelled in euery Temple, but he added holy, and alſo his For in the Temple where God muſt dwell there muſt be no ſinne, nor any elſe with him. The Temple which <hi>Salomon</hi> made vvas very rich, and although it vvas a Temple, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not that it vvas holy, for if it had been, and thoſe alſo which made it, they would not haue killed within it the great Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> hard by the altar, nor they would not haue placed the Idoll <hi>As<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>aroth</hi> in it vpon the altar, nor they vvould not haue conſented that <hi>Pompeius</hi> ſhould haue made a ſtable for his horſes hard by the altar which vvas dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto diuine ſacrifices. Neither was that Temple holy in reſpect of the Prieſts and miniſters which were in it, for if it had beene holy they would not haue had birds at the gate to ſell, nor bankes for Vſurers, nor Chriſt would not haue rebuked them, nor they put Chriſt to death. Neither was that Temple holy in reſpect of the ſacrifices, ſeeing that they were not ſufficient to take away ſinnes: and if there was any profit in them, it was not by reaſon of the ſacrifice which was there offered, but in reſpect of the merits of thoſe which did offer them. Neither vvill vve ſay that <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple vvas holy by reaſon of the matter whereof it was made, becauſe that true and ſincere holineſſe is not in gold, ſiluer, timber, &amp; ſtone, whereof it was made, but in the Chriſtian and glorious Temple which is there aſſembled and gathered together. It followeth then of that which is ſpoken, that God doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide euery where, &amp; where euery man luſteth, but where our Lord wil make his dwelling place muſt be a Temple, and that a holy Temple, and his owne Temple, or els hee will dwell vvith none. Where or vvho is the true Temple vvhere God dwelleth, but the moſt ſacred humanity of the ſon of God?
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:3666:229"/>Wee ſhall call his deified body a Temple, and a holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and his owne Temple: becauſe of him and of no other, God ſaid at the riuer of Iordan, This is my welbeloued ſon. This holy Temple was builded not by the hands of <hi>Salomon</hi> the peaceable, but by the hands and induſtry of the Holy-ghoſt, in whoſe framing and faſhioning as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpent ſeuen yeares, ſo the Holy-ghoſt did endue his with his ſeuen gifts. This our Temple is farre more richer than <hi>Salomons</hi> was, for if his was couered with gold, ſo ours is couered with diuine loue: and the difference betwixt thoſe two may eaſily bee knowne, by the difference that is betwixt a ſimple gilter, and a great louer. In <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple, the things of gold were ſo meaſured, &amp; thoſe of wood ſo leuelled, that when they were laid downe, there was no Ax nor hamber heard: When the Holy-ghoſt did frame the Temple of the moſt ſacred hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of Chriſt in the wombe of the bleſſed Virgine <hi>Mary,</hi> hee framed it ſo iuſt, and made it in all perfection ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, that there was there no axe of ſinne, nor hamber of the diuell. The windowes of that temple were broader with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in than vvithout, to ſignifie vnto vs that the loue which Chriſt had ſecretly in his entrails was farre greater and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than the wounds were which hee ſuffered for vs: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that at the beginning he doth lead his a ſtraight and narrow way, yet after that they doe taſt of his heauenly loue he maketh all things broad and large vnto them. In this holy Temple of Chriſt, we muſt offer pure gold and excellent ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, which wee doe then, when in heart we beleeue him, and with our mouth confeſſe him. There muſt alſo be offered lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, copper, and braſſe, by which we may vnderſtand the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of patience, for as thoſe mettals doe ſuffer many blowes, and ſerue to many vſes, ſo the vertue of patience doth ſuffer many iniuries, and maketh many men vertuous. It is fit for vs to offer there a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Wee ſhould offer alſo in the liuely Temple of that bleſſed humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſcarlet wel coloured and fine: whereby is vnderſtood the memory which wee ought to haue of his holy paſsion, the which if it was troubleſome for him to ſuffer, is moſt profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for vs to contemplate. O how happy ſhould he be of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it might be ſaid, thy hears are like vnto the ſcarlet of the king died in the gutters. What are the heares but my thoughts? and what are the gutters but his precious wounds? and what is the coloured ſcarlet but his moſt precious fleſh, died in his owne precious bloud? O who could be worthy to waſh in this bloud the heares of his thoughts, euery day a little time, for ſeeing them of that colour, they would preſently be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Chriſt. Thou ſhouldeſt offer alſo in this moſt holy Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple ſcarlet twiſe died, that is, loue doubled: &amp; if thou wilt know what loue doubled is, we tell thee that it is the loue of God, and the loue of thy neighbor. He offereth ſcarlet twiſe died, who doth the works of charity vnto his neighbour, and giueth no euill ſpeech vnto any man: and hee doth alſo offer ſcarlet twiſe died who offereth his ſoule vnto God, and part of his goods vnto his neighbour in neceſsity. God did alſo command fine white linnen to be offered vnto him, whereby a chaſt and a clean conuerſation is vnderſtood, becauſe there is nothing in this world in greater danger than the fame of a vertuous perſon. Flie then my brother, flie the occaſions of the world, and truſt not ſo much as thy ſelfe, for how much the finer the thrid of thy fame is, the ſooner it will be broken &amp; ſpotted, if thou haue not a viligant care ouer it. God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded likewiſe that they ſhould offer him in his Temple timber of the wood Cethin, becauſe it was incorruptible, whereby are vnderſtood all perfect works and well finiſhed, and this hee noteth, that if in vertuous workes wee haue not great conſtancy and peſeuerance, the worme dooth conſume them like as they doe timber. God doth alſo command that they ſhould offer in his Temple goats heare, if they had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, nor no other riches, and therevpon the Lord may

                  <pb n="456" facs="tcp:3666:231"/>behold an earthquake. The things which Chriſt ſpake vnto them in this place were ſo high, and the myſtery ſo great which hee diſcouereth vnto them, that they could not onely not vnderſtand it, but they were alſo afeared and began to tremble to heare it: for they thought it a violent thing that they ſhould martyr a holy man, and they thought it a very ſtrange thing that any man ſhould riſe againe. <hi>Theophilus</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on S. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſayth, That it is much to bee noted, that in all other iournies which Chriſt made, it is alwaies ſaid that hee went in the company of his diſciples, this one excepted, where hee ſayth, that hee went before them, to declare the great ioy that hee had, to ſee that hee went to die and ſuffer paſsion for thoſe whom he meant to redeeme and ſaue. The difference betwixt thoſe which take in hand any iourney is this, that hee who goeth with greateſt ioy goeth alwaies for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, becauſe hee would ſooneſt come to the end: and ſo it fell out here, for Chriſt hauing a greater deſire of our rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſaluation than the Apoſtles had, made moſt haſt on the way. <hi>Secretum meum mihi, ſecretum meum mihi,</hi> ſaid God by <hi>Eſayas</hi> chap. 24. as if he would ſay, From the beginning of the world in the deapth of the eternity, I haue kept cloſe a ſecret which no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> knoweth. O infinit good, O high Trinity, what is this ſecret, and from whom doſt thou hide it? If there bee more than one ſecret, why doeſt thou call it two? and if there be but one, why doeſt thou ſay twiſe, My ſecret to my ſelfe, My ſecret to my ſelfe? Hee doth twiſe iterate this word Secret, becauſe there be two myſteries, and yet calleth them in the ſingular number, becauſe they are but of one Chriſt, in whom they were accompliſhed, and for whoſe cauſe they were vnto the world reuealed. What greater ſecret, or what greater myſtery, or what higher Sacrament could there be in the world, than for Chriſt to tell his diſciples, that being God he ſhould die, &amp; being man he ſhould riſe againe? And it was not without a great myſtery that Chriſt would draw his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples from the people, draw them to the way, and talke with them in ſecret, letting them vnderſtand by theſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:3666:231"/>that that which he would tell them ſhould be a great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, ſeeing that he did not tell it the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but in great ſecret. <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſostome</hi> vpon S. <hi>Mathew</hi> ſayth, All the glory of God and all the ſaluation of the Gentiles conſiſteth in the death which Chriſt died, and in the bloud which for al the world he ſhed: and therefore becauſe the myſtery was ſo high &amp; ſo ſtrange, he would not diſcouer it but vnto thoſe of his holy colledge, and vnto them alſo in great ſecret. It was a high myſtery to ſay, That being God he ſhould die; and it was alſo as ſtrange to ſay, That he who was man ſhould riſe again: and he would not reueale it vnto the people, becauſe they ſhould not bee ſcandalized, but reuealed it to thoſe of his holy colledge for their benefit, becauſe that the moſt preciouſeſt treaſures are alwaies kept in the beſt and ſureſt cheſts. It is not then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe that the text ſayth, <hi>Aſſumpſit eos ſecretò,</hi> to let vs thereby vnderſtand, that wee ſhould not reueale high ſecrets to all men, nor yet hide the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from ſome men. Now that Chriſt hath drawne his diſciples into the field, and lead them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what beſide the way, the text ſayth, that hee ſpake ſecretly vnto them, ſaying, Behold wee goe vp to Ieruſalem: as if hee ſhould ſay, My children &amp; my brethren, I will open a ſecret vnto you, ſuch as you haue neuer heard before, that is, that we draw now neere vnto Ieruſalem, where I am to ſuffer, and now the time is come when I muſt ſuffer, &amp; the death which they will giue ſhall be ſuch as my Father hath ordained, and which in the Scripture is prophecied, and which by mee is accepted. And becauſe our Lord here ſayth that he muſt die in Ieruſalem and not els where, the propheſie of the Pſalme is to be conſidered, 73. which ſayth, <hi>Deus autem rex noſter ante ſecula operatus eſt ſalutem in medie terrae.</hi> His meaning is, Our God and our king hath determined to redeeme the world in a place which is in the middle of the world.

According
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:3666:232"/>vnto the propheſie alledged Chriſt dying in Ieruſalem, hee died in the middle of the world, becauſe that Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath on the South ſide the kingdome of Aegypt, on the Eaſt ſide the kingdome of Arabia, and on the Weſt ſide the Medite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

By reaſon wherof, our Redeemer of the world would die in the middeſt of all men, ſeeing that he ſuffered for all men. <hi>Barnard</hi> in an Epiſtle ſayth, When the Prophet ſaith, that our Lord hath wrought our ſaluation in the middle of the earth, hee meaneth that he loueth the mean very much, &amp; hateth extreames: for he doth aſwell hate the extream of faſting, as ouermuch eating; and hee hateth as well extreame pouerty as too much vvealth; and he hateth as well too great baſeneſſe of mind as extream pride; and hee hateth as well extreame ignorance as ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much eloquence. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſayth, In this thou maieſt ſee what an enemy Chriſt is to extreamties, and how little hee fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth ſuch as vſe them, in that, that for to giue vs an example, that in all thinges wee ſhould cleaue to the meane, and flie the extreames, his will was to die in the middle of all the world. Wee muſt note alſo, that Chriſt ſayth, <hi>Ecce aſcendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> for by this hee ſheweth that hee goeth not to his death forced or conſtrained by any, but of his owne loue: the vvhich infinite loue as it brought him from heauen to take fleſh, ſo it dooth lead him to die on the croſſe. When the ſon of God ſayth vnto his Diſciples, Behold we go vp to Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, this is no ſpeech of a malefactor, but of a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, becauſe the vvicked man neuer ſayth vnto his friendes, I goe to die, but looke they carry or lead
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:3666:232"/>mee to receiue iuſtice. O high myſtery, O diuine Sacrament, vvho euer heard that ſuch a man as Chriſt vvas, young, healthfull, free, and iuſt, of his owne proper vvill ſhould ſay vnto his Diſciples, Behold I go to Ieruſalem to die: as if hee vvould ſay, Behold I goe to bee merry and to great ioy. <hi>Aymon</hi> ſayth, What ſayth hee elſe vvhen hee ſayth, Behold vve goe vp to Ieruſalem, but make it knowen vnto the rulers of the church, that he goeth to die before his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation bee drawne, before the ſergeants do take him, before the hangmen doe keepe him, and before that the iudge hath giuen ſentence on him. <hi>Rabanus</hi> vpon this place ſayth, When Chriſt ſayth vnto his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Behold vvee goe vp to Ieruſalem: it is as if hee vvould ſay, Behold and marke vvell, that when you ſhall ſee mee hanged vpon the croſſe like vnto a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, doe not thinke that I am onely a man, for if to die bee the condition of a man, yet to die vvillingly is the property of God alone. Hee vvho is a pure man dieth although hee vvould not, but hee vvho is God and man dieth vvhen hee vvill: and ſuch vvas the ſonne of God, vvho tooke death vvhen hee vvould, and took againe his life vvhen it pleaſed him. <hi>Remigius</hi> in a certaine Homily ſayth, In this ſpeech of, [Behold vvee goe vp to Ieruſalem] the ſonne of God dooth ſhew two things vnto vs, that is, That hee goeth to die; and that hee go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to ſuffer that death of his owne accord: ſo that we owe him for two debts, the one for the bloud vvhich hee ſhed, and the other for the loue vvith the vvhich he ſhed it. <hi>Cyrillus</hi> ſaith alſo, If as Chriſt ſaid, Behold I goe to Ieruſalem to die of my owne voluntary vvill, hee ſhould haue ſaid, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold they draw me to be iuſticied by force; vve ſhould haue ben bound vnto him for the martirdome which he ſuffered, &amp; not for the wil vvith the which he ſuffered. But ſeeing he ſaith plainly that he goeth of his own voluntary vvill, to the but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of the Mount of Caluary to bee executed; it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that if vvee owe him much for that hee did ſuffer,
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:3666:233"/>we owe him much more for the loue vvith the which he did ſuffer. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ſayth likewiſe in this ſpeech of <hi>Ecce aſcendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> our great ſheepheard dooth admoniſh all other ſheepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, that when neceſsity doth ſo require, they ſhould not oppoſe themſelues againſt any tyrant if they vvould put the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to death, but alſo offer themſelues to death for the ſaluation of their flocke: becauſe there is no higher degree of martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, than to die for the ſauing of his neighbour. <hi>Simon de Gaſsia</hi> ſayth, For the ſonne of God to ſay vnto his diſciples, Behold I goe to die, and not, They carry mee to kill me; was to let them vnderſtand, that to the Chriſtian religion, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion of the Goſpell vvee ſhould not bee drawne by force, but goe willingly, becauſe our Lord doth not ſo much regard the feet with the which wee ſeeke him, as hee doth behold out intentions with which we loue him. And Chriſt ſaith fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Et conſummabuntur omnia quae ſcripta ſunt de me,</hi> as if he would ſay, The cauſe vvhy I goe to Ieruſalem is becauſe all things vvhich are vvritten of mee by the Prophets may bee fulfilled and accompliſhed. <hi>Origen</hi> ſayth, All thinges vvhich vvere vvritten of Chriſt are brought vnto three things, and all thoſe to be fulfilled by him, to wit, that vvhich he ſhould doe, that vvhich he ſhould ſuffer, and the reward vvhich he ſhould haue, aſwell for that vvhich hee did in his life, as for that vvhich he ſuffered at his death. That which Chriſt did, vvas to plant the church: that vvhich he ſuffered, was a moſt cruell death: &amp; the reward vvhich he receiued, vvas his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reſurrection: inſomuch that in his holy life, in his dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full death and paſsion, and glorious reſurrection, all the holy Scripture is contained. Theſe two ſpeeches vvhich Chriſt ſpake doe very vvell agree, that is, that vvhich he ſayth here <hi>Conſummabuntur omnia,</hi> and the other vvhich he vttered vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the croſſe <hi>Conſummatum eſt.</hi> For in that, that he died and roſe againe, all vvas fulfilled that was vvritten of him. But ſpeaking more particularly, Chriſt ſayth, that in entring into Ieruſalem, he ſhould be deliuered vnto the Gentils, and that he ſhould bee mocked vvith iniurious vvords, and ſpet vpon
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:3666:233"/>with groſſe ſpettle, and whipped with much diſcipline, and that he ſhould alſo bee crucified and put to death with great nailes. Who euer ſaw or heard the like vnto this, that they ſhould vnload ſuch a heape of iniuries, and ſuch a multitude of torments vpon ſo tender a body, and ſo iuſt a perſon? <hi>Dedit percutientibus ſe maxillam, &amp; ſaturabitur opprebrijs,</hi> ſaith <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> chap. 3. Speaking of Chriſts iniuries, as if hee ſhould ſay, The redeemer of the world will bee ſo patient in his trauails, and ſo obedient vnto his perſecutors, that hee himſelfe will offer his cheeke to be buffetted, and he will put himſelfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, becauſe they ſhould fill him with iniuries. How well ſo euer <hi>Ieremy</hi> did propheſie this, yet Chriſt did fulfill it better, ſeeing that he offered vnto his enemies not onely his cheeke that they might buffet it, but alſo all his holy body that they might kill it. What meaneth this O good Ieſus, what meaneth this, The Prophet <hi>Elias</hi> did ſhe from the citie of Ieruſalem, becauſe Queene <hi>Iezabel</hi> ſhould not cut off his head, and doeſt thou goe to Ieruſalem, where thou knoweſt that they wil depriue thee of thy life? Great king <hi>Dauid</hi> fled from the city of Ieruſalem, and went out of it, becauſe hee would bee no more perſecuted of king <hi>Saul,</hi> and doeſt thou goe to Ieruſalem to bee crucified? In this point ſure thou art not <hi>Dauids</hi> ſonne, nor <hi>Helias</hi> companion, for if they flie from Ieruſalem to ſaue their liues, thou goeſt to Ieruſalem to offer thy ſelfe to death. If thy death had been a common death, it might haue been born with, but ſeeing that it was more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous to ſuffer the circumſtances of thy death, than death it ſelfe, what neceſsity conſtrained thee, or what charity moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued thee why thou ſhouldeſt not haue fled with thy Father <hi>Dauid,</hi> or abſented thee with the Prophet <hi>Ely?</hi> It is a thing worthy to bee noted, that Chriſt putteth it for the greateſt point of his Martyrdome that he ſhould be iniuried, and alſo that he ſhould be ſcorned and mocked. By which complaint hee doth let vs vnderſtand, that the ſonne of God did grieue more at the iniurious words which they ſpake vnto him, than at the laſhes and diſcipline which they gaue him. <hi>Ieremy</hi> doth
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:3666:234"/>not ſay that Chriſt ſhould be filled in his paſsion with ſtripes <hi>flagellis,</hi> but <hi>opprobrijs,</hi> reuilings and iniuries, and the reaſon is, becauſe ſtripes &amp; laſhes paſſe no further than the ſhoulders, but iniuries entred vnto the entrails. Who is he in the world which wil not be more grieued at an iniurious word, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the point of a ſpeare? <hi>Ieremy</hi> maketh no reckoning of the thornes, nor of the nailes, nor of the laſhes, but onely of the iniuries which Chriſt ſuffered, ſeeing that hee ſaith, <hi>Saturabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur opprobrijs,</hi> becauſe hee paſſed through thoſe torments but one day, but hee ſuffered iniuries and blaſphemies euery day. In theſe words of <hi>Ieremies,</hi> He ſhall be filled with iniuries: he ſignified vnto vs, the cruelty of his torments and the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his iniuries: for as hee who is full, hath no more place in his ſtomacke to fill, ſo there was no torment which to the ſonne of God they left vngiuen, nor no iniury vnſpoken. For what torments were there which they gaue him not, or what iniuries could there be ſpoken which they vttered not. <hi>Hugo de ſancto victore</hi> vpon <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſayth, Becauſe the ſon of God would declare that hee was the iuſteſt of all others, and of all martyrs the greateſt martyr, he ſaid that he ſhould be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with iniuries and reuilings: becauſe that in all other mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, they did lay hands with no other intention, but to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr them, but in Chriſt they laid hands to kill him, &amp; tongues to iniury him. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> on this place ſayth, <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſaith very well of Chriſt, <hi>Quod ſaturabitur opprobrijs:</hi> for wee doe not read of any Martyr, that he was martyred with tongues, but with hands, the ſon of God alone is he, whoſe life they tooke away with their hands, and fame with their tongues. <hi>Iſichius</hi> vpon Leuiticus ſayth, With great reaſon, the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſayth of Chriſt, That he ſhould be filled with iniuries: ſeeing wee ſee, that in his holy paſsion, liers doe ſell the truth, ſooles mocke wiſedome, the guilty whip innocency, the wretched ſpet vpon glory, and the dead kill life. S. <hi>Barnard</hi> in a ſermon of the paſsion ſayth, What heart is able to endure it, or what fingers able to write it, to ſee that the liberty of captiues is ſold, the glory of Angels ſcorned and mocked, the morning
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:3666:234"/>ſtarre of the world ſpet at, the Lord of all ſcourged &amp; whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and he who is the rewarder of trauels murthered? S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> vpon S. <hi>Luke</hi> ſayth, Of Chriſt only, &amp; of no other <hi>Ieremy</hi> ſayth, <hi>Quod ſaturabitur opprobrijs:</hi> ſeeing that he was ſold like a malefactor, mocked like a foole, ſpet at like a vile perſon, whipped like a theefe, and put to death like a traitor. S. <hi>Hilary</hi> in an Homily ſayth, According vnto the propheſie of <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> the ſonne of God ſhall be filled with iniuries, ſeeing that he is ſold of the Symoniacles, mocked of hypocrites, whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of tyrants, ſpet at by blaſphemers, and put to death by heretikes. Let our concluſion then be, that not without a high myſtery, nor profound ſacrament, Chriſt before hee ſhould ſuffer, ſaid theſe words of <hi>Conſummabuntur,</hi> and in the end of his ſuffering, <hi>Conſummatum eſt,</hi> to let vs vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that at one time Chriſts life did end: and if we be ſuch as we ought to be our faults.</p>

Theſe words are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the mouth of the ſon of God, praying vnto his Father, after he had made a ſermon before ſupper, the higheſt and longeſt that euer hee preached in all his life time, as if hee ſhould ſay, O my holy, eternall, mighty and bleſſed Father,
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:3666:235"/>that which I entreat and requeſt of thee in this laſt houre is, that ſeeing I haue giuen to my Diſciples part of the light and ſcience which thou haſt giuen mee, thou wouldeſt alſo giue them grace to bee perfect in that kind of perfection as thou are wont to make perfect the elect.

It is here to be noted, who hee is which praieth, where hee praieth, when he praieth, and how he praieth, and for whome he praieth, &amp; what he praieth: for oftentimes in Scripture the circumſtances how a thing is done, makes it either weighty or very weighty.

                  </gap>or; the time, is at ſupper; how, is with lifting vp his eies; the things which hee praieth, are very high; they for whom, are his diſciples. In this high praier Chriſt ſpake dainty words, moſt graue ſentences, very ſecret myſteries, very neceſſary aduiſes, and very profitable counſels; by reaſon whereof, it is conuenient to read them with attention, and note them with deuotion. Chriſt then ſayth in the beginning of his praier, <hi>Pater ſancte ſerua eos in nomine tuo qui tui ſunt, &amp; pro eis rogo &amp; non pro mundo,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, My holy and bleſſed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that which I ask of thee for theſe thy children and my diſciples, is, that thou deliuer them from ſin, &amp; keep them in thy ſeruice, ſeeing that they bee my brothers by nature, and thy children by grace: and if I aske any thing of thee it is not for thoſe which are of the world, but for thoſe which thou doeſt keepe vnder thy ſafegard. O ſweet words for the good, and ſorrowfull for the bad, ſeeing that by them are diuided and ſeperated the perfect from the foreſeene, the elect from the reprobate, Gods friends from the children of perdition, and alſo the neighbours of heauen from the louers of the world. Howſoeuer Chriſt our redeemer praied from the hart for thoſe which he loued from the heart, yet he ſet this word
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:3666:235"/>
                  <hi>Sancte Pater</hi> before his praier, becauſe it is a very naturall thing, that this word <hi>Pater,</hi> maketh a father attentiue to here the child, and maketh his eies tender to behold him, and his heart gentle to loue him, and openeth his entrails that hee can deny him nothing. What ſweeter words can come to a fathers eares, than to heare his ſonne call him father? As a ſonne welbeloued and tendered, once Chriſt calleth his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my father, another time iuſt father, &amp; another time Lord and father, ſometimes holy father, and ſometimes father and nothing elſe, ſo that ſuch as his praier was, ſuch was the name which hee gaue him. It is not then here without a myſtery, that hee calleth him <hi>Pater ſancte,</hi> becauſe hee who praied in this praier was moſt holy, hee to whom hee praied was holy, that which hee praied were holy things, the place where hee praied was a holy place, and hee for whom he praied was his holy colledge. What doeſt thou aske O good Ieſus, what doeſt thou aske? Pardon for my ſheepe, that God would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer them from Wolues, pardon for my diſciples, that God would keepe them from the diuell, pardon for my elect that God would ſeperate them from ſinne, and pardon for my friendes that God would take them vp into heauen. As thou art going thy iourney to the croſſe, at the point of death, in the euening of thy agony, and whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they come to apprehend thy perſon, among ſo many thinges which thou doeſt aske of thy Father, doeſt thou ask nothing for thy ſelfe? O heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly care, O vnſpeakable loue, O charity neuer heard of before, ſuch as thine is O creator of my ſoule towards all mankind, ſeeing that in ſuch a diſmal day, in ſuch a narrow ſtrait as thou art in, thou haſt cauſe ſufficient to craue of thy father for thy ſelfe, ſauing only that to remember me thou doeſt forget thy ſelfe. And Chriſt ſayth that he doth aske for ſuch as are his, that is, for thoſe which in the depth of his eternity are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated, and are in the number of the elect, to the end that they may bee one thing in the father, as the father and the ſonne are one thing. Let the curious reader marke in this place, that this abuerbe <hi>Sicut</hi> dooth not in this place make an
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:3666:236"/>equality betwixt God and man, but onely a reſemblance, and a likeneſſe for vnlike, the which becauſe <hi>Arrias</hi> would not vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, became to be an infamous heretike. When Chriſt ſaid <hi>Sint vnum in me,</hi> his meaning was this, That which I aske of thee (O heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly Father) is, that as thoſe of my colledge be thy children and my brethren by grace, I am thy only begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſonne by nature. Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> vpon this place ſaith, As the father and the ſonne are one, and the ſame thing, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by equality of ſubſtance, but alſo for equality of will, ſo the diſciples are one thing with Chriſt, not by nature, but by a bond of loue and fellowſhip. And he addeth further, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the perfection of a iuſt man is no other thing but the participation which he hath with the diuine likeneſſe, we are good in ſo many degrees, in how many we draw neere to the likeneſſe of God. Chriſt ſayth plainly for whom hee praieth ſeeing he ſayth, <hi>Quia tui ſunt;</hi> and alſo for whom he doth not pray, ſeeing he ſayth, That he doth not aske for the world: ſo that thoſe be participant of his praier which do ſerue Chriſt, and he excludeth thoſe which follow the world. O how hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py thoſe be which follow Chriſt, and which loue Chriſt, and ſerue Chriſt, becauſe they only be partakers of his praier, the which loue and ſeruice euery man ſhould proue in himſelfe, not in the words which hee ſpeaketh of Chriſt, but in the workes which he doth for his ſeruice. <hi>Chriſostome</hi> ſaith, We ſhould bee afeard very much my brethren, that Chriſt did not ſay, I pray vnto thee father for thoſe who cal themſelues thine, but onely for thoſe which are thine, becauſe there are many now adaies in the church of God who are baptiſed, &amp; call themſelues Chriſtians, and doe goe to church, who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are gone from thence, are prowd, enuious, couetous, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and blaſphemers; of which wee may ſay, that they call themſelues of Chriſt, but they bee not of Chriſt. For ſuch beaſts as theſe, Chriſt doth not pray, nor ſuch naughty men as theſe haue no part in Chriſts praier, not becauſe Chriſts holy praier doth not reach vnto all, but becauſe they remaine out of it becauſe they continue in their ſinnes. <hi>Cyrillus</hi> vpon Saint
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:3666:236"/>
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayth, Why doeſt thou aske for thy diſciples, for if they bee thy Fathers, thou haſt no need, and if they bee not his what haſt thou to doe with them? That which I aske for them is, that as they are his by faith, they may be his alſo by charity, for it would little auaile them to bee conſtant in faith if they ſhould not be alſo feruent in loue. <hi>Remigius</hi> ſayth, There is no doubt but the ſonne of God was neuer asked by any, nor importuned by any, nor ſuborned by any to pray for thoſe of his colledge, but of himſelfe, hee moued himſelfe to pray, and commend them to his Father, giuing vs thereby to vnderſtand, what great care he hath to looke vnto vs, if wee be not careleſſe to ſerue him. But how ſhould not that other part make vs afeard &amp; aſtonied, when Chriſt ſaid [I pray not for the world] ſeeing hee excludeth from his praier all vaine light worldlings, which are al worthily ſhut out of his church, ſeeing they would not follow his doctrine. When the ſonne of God ſayth, <hi>Non rogo pro mundo,</hi> hee ſayth that he doth not pray for the proud man, hee ſayth that hee doth not pray for the enuious man, for the fleſhly man, for the couetous man, for the blaſphemer, for vnto ſuch perſons their paradiſe is their vices, and hell Gods comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts. How (ſaith Chriſt) ſhall I aske for the world, ſeeing I am not knowne of any neighbour in it? <hi>Rupertus</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayth, Seeing that Chriſt ſayth, I doe not aske for the world, let euery man mark what life hee leadeth, for thereby hee may ſee what part hee hath in Chriſts praier, for the rewarder of vertues is Chriſt, and the pay-maiſter of vices is the diuell. Tel me I pray thee why the ſonne of God ſhould pray for them which are blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the world, and whoſe glory is this wicked world, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the captaine and ringleader of ſuch is the diuell? S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſayth, Why doth the ſonne of God ſay in his praier [I do not entreat for the world] but becauſe the tranſgreſſor of the precept is hee who committeth the ſinne, and hee who committeth the ſinne is the louer of the world, and the louer of the world is the ſeruant of the diuell, and the ſeruant of the diuell is a neighbor and inhabitant of hell.
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:3666:237"/>
                  <hi>Bonauenture</hi> in the life of Chriſt ſayth, When the deuill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about to make me ſinne, and when the fleſh goeth about to ouercome mee, and when the world goeth about to pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and make much of me, I preſently doe call to mind that ſpeech of Chriſt, I pray not for the world; and that, Riſe to iudgement; and that, Goe into euerlaſting fire. Although theſe three enemies are ſtrong to ouercome, yet theſe are three mighty arrowes to ſhoot at them: for if we remember, I doe not pray the father for the world, Riſe to iudgement, Go into euerlaſting fire; who dare commit a ſinne, nor yet take his ſleepe by night? Chriſt ſayth further, <hi>Non pro eis tantum rogo, ſed pro eis qui credituriſunt in me,</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, O my holy and bleſſed Father, behold that my church muſt be very much encreaſed, and muſt dure vnto the worlds end, by reaſon whereof, I doe not aske thee only for theſe which ſit at my table, but alſo for all thoſe vvhich vvill beleeue in mee hereafter. And hee ſayth further, <hi>Non rogo vt tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las eos de mundo, ſed vt ſerues cos a malo,</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, Although my elect bee not of the vvorld, nor haue no part in the vvorld, and the vvorld hate them, yet I doe not aske thee that thou vvouldeſt take them out of the vvorld, but that thou vvouldeſt deliuer them from all euill. Speaking litterally, our Lord asketh here of his Father, that hee vvould not take all his Diſciples ſo ſoone out of the world, partly becauſe they bee not well grounded in matters of perfection, and partly becauſe the Gentiles ſhould be lightned by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; if they ſhould haue died with Chriſt, all the world ſhould haue ben vnconuerted. <hi>Theophilus</hi> ſaith, When the ſon of God ſayth vnto his Father, I doe not craue of thee that thou wouldeſt take them out of this world, but that thou wouldeſt keepe them from euill, aboue all things I ſay, that bleſſed be that mouth which ſpake that, &amp; bleſſed be they for whom he ſpake it, ſeeing thereby wee bee certified, that how bad ſo euer wee bee, our Lord doth labour alwaies to bring vs to his ſeruice. Marke then the infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and charitie of our Lord, who when hee had ſaid,
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:3666:237"/>I doe not aske for the world, ſayth preſently, I doe not deſire that thou wouldeſt take them out of the world. The which words he ſpake immediately after the other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe wee ſhould not bee bold to ſinne, truſting vnto Gods mercy, and yet if wee doe chance to fall, that wee ſhould not perſeuere and diſpaire. To ſay that Chriſt ſhould not entreat for the world, it is a dreadfull ſpeech, and yet to pray that he ſhould not ſpoile the world of the good, is a ſpeech of great comfort: for ſeeing that hee would not haue the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good ones, it is a ſigne that hee would that by them wee ſhould be conuerted. When the Lord would drowne all the world with a floud, he did firſt put <hi>Noe</hi> in ſafety; and when he would ſend fire vpon Sodome and Gomorra, hee placed <hi>Lot</hi> vpon a high hill; and when hee would puniſh the murmurers in the deſert, hee commanded <hi>Moyſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to goe out to the field: ſo that it is a great ſigne that God is angry with ſome when hee taketh the good out of their company. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy <hi>Iudas</hi> immediately after hee had departed out of that holy colledge, hanged himſelfe; and it happened otherwiſe in S. <hi>Peter,</hi> whom although Chriſt ſuffered to fall, yet hee did not abandon him and put him out of his ſight, for as ſoone as hee had committed the fault Chriſt preſently looked him in the face. <hi>Iudas</hi> was a diſciple, and S. <hi>Peter</hi> was a diſciple, <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> did ſinne, and S. <hi>Peter</hi> did ſinne, the one did ſell Chriſt, &amp; the other did denie Chriſt, <hi>Iudas</hi> was damned, and S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaued, and the reaſon was, becauſe Chriſt was where <hi>Peter</hi> ſinned, and would not bee where <hi>Iudas</hi> did hang himſelfe. In the two great captiuities of Babilon, there were many iuſt men carried away captiue among the wicked, as <hi>Thobias, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niell,</hi> and <hi>Eſdras,</hi> and <hi>Abdias,</hi> all which our Lord did ſend thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not becauſe they had committed any ſinne againſt him, but for the conſolation and remedy of ſome ſinners. What ſhould become of ſinners and naughty perſons, if our Lord ſhould take away all good men from amongſt them? In the merit of the good and vertuous, God doth ſuſtaine vs which are ſinners; for otherwiſe, becauſe we are Gods enemies the
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:3666:238"/>ſonne would not ſhine vpon vs, nor the heauen would not raine vpon vs, the aire would moue it ſelfe, and the earth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and wild beaſtes would deuour vs, and the diuels would kil vs. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſayth, That ſinners may haue great hope when our Lord dooth not draw the iuſt from among them, for in not ſeperating the good from the bad, it is a token that by the merits and handes of thoſe good men, hee will draw vs from that which is naught, and lead vs to that vvhich is good. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſayth, In thoſe words which Chriſt ſpake [I aske not for the world] hee dooth threaten vs with his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: and in the other ſpeech of, <hi>[Non tollas eos de mundo]</hi> hee doth flatter vs with his mercy, ſeeing that in the one hee ſetteth away the obſtinate from obtaining of mercy, and in the other hee giueth hope vnto the weake, that they ſhall haue part in his clemency. I beſeech thee then O my good Ieſus, I beſeech thee, that thou wouldeſt not ſeperate mee from among the good, or elſe put not the good from mee, for if I ſhould not bee good for conſcience, at the leaſt I ſhould bee for ſhame. It is alſo much to bee noted, that our Lord dooth not entreat his Father, that hee would not take the good out of the world, but that hee would keepe them from all perill and daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: in ſo much that in his moſt high praier hee dooth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forget the vveake, nor bee careleſſe of the good, becauſe for ſinners hee praieth that they bee not forſaken of the good, and for the iuſt hee praieth, that they bee not ouermaiſtered by ſinners. If it bee true that Saint <hi>Gregory</hi> ſayth, <hi>Deus qui nos in tantis periculis,</hi> and that the Apoſtle ſayth, <hi>Periculum in mari, periculum in terra,</hi> and alſo the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Hoc mare magnum &amp; ſpecioſum,</hi> why doth not the ſonne of God pray that his Father would deliuer vs from more than one danger, ſeeing there are ſo many in the world? It ſeemeth that there ſhould bee ſome great euill in the vvorld, ſeeing that Chriſt maketh mention of it and of no other, as ſo it is truly, for if that euill had not come into
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:3666:238"/>the world, there ſhould haue beene no hell in the other. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſayth, As in heauen there is one holy one aboue all holy ones, which is God, and in hell there is one euill aboue all euils which is the diuell, ſo there is in the world one naughty thing which paſſeth all the reſt which is ſinne. Tell mee I pray thee what naughtineſſe would there bee in the world, if in the world there were no ſinne? Hunger and cold, thirſt and wearineſſe, we do vniuſtly call euils or naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty things, becauſe they are not naught of themſelues, but onely the reliques of that great euill, for if wee had not knowne what thing ſinne had beene, neither ſhould vvee haue knowne what hunger and cold had meant. For to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vs from this great euill Chriſt dooth teach vs to pray, when wee ſay, <hi>Sed libera nos a malo,</hi> and ſo Chriſt in his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſayth, <hi>Non rogo vt tollas eos de mundo, ſed vt liberes eos de malo.</hi> So that wee are to craue nothing elſe of our Lord, but that hee would deliuer vs from ſinne, and guide vs in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice. What doeſt thou aske thy Father O my good Ieſus for thy elect, what doeſt thou ask for thy welbeloued diſciples? I doe not aske riches for them, for that is a fraile thing; I doe not aske honour for them, for that is a vaine thing; nor life, for that is tranſitory; nor eaſe, becauſe there is none in this world; I aske onely that thou wouldeſt deliuer them from ſinne, for my diſciples cannot poſſeſſe greater riches than to haue their hearts cleare from ſinnes. Chriſt addeth further in his praier and ſayth, <hi>Non pro eis tantum rogo, ſed pro eis qui credituri ſunt in me,</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, I doe not pray onely (O my Father) for theſe which eat at my table, but for all thoſe which will hereafter enter into my church; becauſe that thou being in mee by nature, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them by grace, they may bee perfect in one perfect charitie. Chriſt made his praier in very good order, for firſt hee praied for himſelfe, then for his Diſciples, then for weake ſinners, and in the end for all thoſe vvhich vvere to come. If Chriſt ſhould haue
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:3666:239"/>praied only for thoſe which ſat at his table, what ſhould haue become of all thoſe which ſhould afterward be borne in his catholicke church? <hi>Chriſoſtome</hi> ſayth, That Chriſt praied for the quicke and for the dead, for the preſent and for the abſent, for thoſe which were already born, &amp; for thoſe which ſhould afterward be born, inſomuch that all the fauors which. God dooth for vs at this day, Chriſt did merit for vs by his life and bloud, and obtained them with his praier. S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> ſayth, In the merit of thoſe words which Chriſt ſpake in his praier, <hi>Non tantum pro eis rogo,</hi> wee which are now in his church haue as great part in the merits of this life in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing of his bloud, and in the perfection of his praier, as his diſciples which were with him then at his table. O glorious ſpeech, O bleſſed praier which Chriſt vſed when hee ſaid, I doe not pray for them only, but for thoſe which ſhall hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beleeue in me, although we had neuer ſeen him, nor done him any ſeruice at all, nor deſerued any loue at his hands, yet he praied with as great affection for vs as for thoſe which ſat at his table. <hi>Rabanus</hi> ſayth, Becauſe the ſonne of God was the founder of the church, he praied vnto his father for thoſe of his church, not forgetting nor excluding any one: by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereof, we ſhall aske with great confidence thoſe things which belong to the ſaluation of our ſoule, for ſeeing he doth pray to his Father for thoſe things which are fit for vs, it is to be beleeued, that he will not deny vs of that which himſelfe poſſeſſeth. <hi>Theophilus</hi> ſayth, Marke well that Chriſt dooth not pray here for thoſe which beleeue that there is a God, but onely for thoſe which doe beleeue in God. The Pagan doth beleeue that there is a God, the diuell doth know well that to be true which God ſaith, but onely the good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an doth beleeue in God, becauſe hee doth that which God dooth command him. There bee many which beleeue that there is a God as the Pagan dooth, and beleeue God as the diuel doth, but they do not beleeue in God as the good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian doth: for the Apoſtle ſayth, that our faith is not knowne by the words which we ſpeake, but in the good works which
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:3666:239"/>we doe. Chriſt doth conclude &amp; ſayth, <hi>Vt omnes ſint Conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mati in vnum,</hi> that is, hee entreateth his Father, that all thoſe which be at his table, and all thoſe which ſhall after ſucceed in his catholicke church may end in one faith, in one bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, in one loue, and in one charity.</p>

God ſpake theſe words to holy <hi>Moyſes,</hi> giuing him order how the Prieſts ſhould be appointed, and how the ſacrifices ſhould be offered, as if he would ſay, If any Hebrew will offer vnto God any fruit to bee fried in a frying pan, the floure muſt bee kned with oile, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leauen, and after it is well fried, and oile ſprinkled vpon it, and cut into very ſmal peeces, ſo offered vnto <hi>Aaron,</hi> to bee offered vpon the altar. Before wee come to expound theſe myſteries, we muſt ſhew the cauſe why our Lord would buſie and occupy the people of the Iewes, in ſuch ſtrange rites, in ſuch new ſacrifices, and in ſo many ceremonies, being as hee was, ſo graue a Lord, and ſo mighty a God. <hi>Stapulenſis</hi> in the firſt of <hi>Leuiticus</hi> ſayth, That for three cauſes God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Iewes, to offer ſo many ſmall ſacrifices, and made with ſo many ceremonies. The firſt is, that becauſe the Iews had beene brought vp in Aegypt, where all were idolatours, and they giuen to Idolatry, the Lord would that they ſhould offer thoſe ſacrifices vnto him, and not to the gods of the Gentiles. The ſecond reaſon is, that becauſe vnder thoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:3666:240"/>hee would declare and figure the true ſacrifice which ſhould come into the world which was his precious ſonne. The third reaſon is, that being occupied in that multitude of ſacrifices they ſhould haue no time to beſtow in committing of other ſinnes, becauſe the foundation of all wickedneſſe is accurſed idleneſſe. It is alſo to be noted, that there was ſeuen kinds of ſacrifices in the old law, vnto the which all other were reduced, although they ſeemed to be infinite. The firſt ſacrifice was called <hi>Holocauſtum,</hi> which was the greateſt and moſt ſumptuouſt of all, becauſe it was offered vnto our Lord without any other reſpect: the ſecond was called <hi>Pacificum</hi> becauſe it was offered in time of warre, partly becauſe our Lord ſhould giue them peace in their times, and partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſhould giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> victory againſt their enemies. The third was called <hi>Propiciatory</hi> which was offered in time of great dearth or peſtilence, and the end of it was becauſe our Lord ſhould withdraw his hand from ouer them, and take that plague from them. The fourth was called <hi>Pontificat,</hi> which was offered for the ſinnes of the prieſt of the Temple, and the end of it was, becauſe they did hold it certaine, that if the Prieſt were loaden with ſinnes, that the Lord at his handes would not accept the ſacrifices. The fift was called <hi>Regale,</hi> which was offered for the ſinnes which the king had committed, and the end of it was, becauſe the Lord ſhould pardon the ſins which he had committed, &amp; lighten him to gouern well his Commonwealth. The ſixt was called Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, which was offered for the ſins of all the people of Iſrael, &amp; the end of it was, that the Lord ſhould take them vnder his protection, &amp; look vpon that people. The ſeuenth was called Particular, &amp; this was offered for euery particular perſon, and the end of it was, that God ſhould pardon him for that which was paſt, &amp; giue him grace to amend hereafter. All theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices differed in the beaſts which were offered in them, &amp; in the ceremonies with the which they were offered: and in one thing they all agreed, that is, that there could no ſacrifice be made for the remiſsion of any ſin, vnleſſe the bloud of one
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:3666:240"/>cleane beaſt were ſhed. The Apoſtle ſaid not without great cauſe, <hi>Non fit ſanguinis effuſio ſed remiſsio,</hi> becauſe no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> could bee made cleane of a fault in the old law but by the death of ſome beaſt. <hi>Origen</hi> ſayth, It is certain that euery beaſt doth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liue by his bloud, than by his fleſh, or members, or bones which he goeth with, for when he leaueth bleeding, hee lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth breathing. Although it bee true, that in recompence of the leaſt fault, we are bound to offer our life for it, yet God in the old law was content with the life of a dead beaſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of the life which that Iew did owe him. O how happie we be which fight vnder the name of Chriſt, becauſe the pariſhioners of the ſynagogue did offer the bloud of dead beaſts, but the faithful Chriſtians offer nothing but the bloud of the ſonne of the liuing God; inſomuch that we haue no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity to offer our liues in recompence of our offences, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the life of one was ſufficient to make cleane all the faults of the world. S. <hi>Paule</hi> could not praiſe Chriſts buying of vs better, than to ſay, <hi>Emptiestis pretio magno,</hi> giuing vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to vnderſtand, that with the bloud of his vaines hee had bought our liues, and alſo taken away our offences. For to haue pardoned a Iew of his fault, it was neceſſary euery time that hee had ſinned, to kill a beaſt: but in Chriſts holy law one death tooke away all deaths, one life did buy all liues, and one paine tooke away all paines and offences. When the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle calleth Chriſt, <hi>Hostiam viuentem,</hi> he wanteth not a deepe ſecret and a profound myſtery, becauſe that in the old law they called <hi>Hostia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> the ſacrifice which was offered againſt thoſe which were enemies, &amp; they offered nothing but dead ſacrifices, becauſe the beaſt which they did offer was neither called ſacrifice, nor <hi>Hostia,</hi> vntill his life had been taken from him. The ſonne of God gaue the name of <hi>Hoſtia</hi> a ſacrifice when he died, and the name of life when he roſe againe, and therefore wee may very well call him a liuely ſacrifice, a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſacrifice, a pure ſacrifice, and holy bread, ſeeing that hee is the ſacrifice and <hi>Hostie</hi> which giueth life vnto all,
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:3666:241"/>and is the holieſt ſacrifice of all other, and the pureſt, and the cleaneſt bread of all others. <hi>Anima cum obtulerit oblationem ſacrificij domino ſimilae erit eius oblatio &amp; fundet ſuper eam ole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, &amp; ponet thus, Leuit.</hi> 2. God ſpake theſe words vnto <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> becauſe he ſhould tel them the people of Iſrael, as if hee ſhould ſay, If any will offer any ſacrifice which ſhall bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable vnto mee, offer mee it of the pureſt floure mingled with oile, and therewithall he ſhal adde a little frankincenſe. If wee doe curiouſly looke vnto it, of three things onely our Lord requireth an offering of vs, that is pure floure, good oile, and ſweet incenſe; the which things are eaſiy to bee found, light to offer, and not coſtly to buy. S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſayth, In this wee may ſee what a great deſire our Lord hath to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the ſinnes which we commit againſt him, in that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe doth teach vs what ſacrifices we ſhould offer vnto him. What is vnderſtood by that fine ſifted floure, but that moſt ſacred humanity of the ſonne of God? This holy floure was ſo ſifted and putrified, that all the Angels which ſhall come to ſee it, and all the men in the world which ſhall come to clenſe it, ſhall not find in that ſacred humanity one ſmal grite of originall ſinne, nor on ſpot of mortall ſinne, nor one little duſt of any other ſmall ſinne. Of this moſt pure floure Chriſt did knead the ſacramentall bread in his laſt ſupper, which he left vs in the church, which doth differ farre from that which mother <hi>Eue</hi> did leaue her children, becauſe that in eating of that we doe ſinne, and receiuing of this we doe liue. What is the incenſe which God commaunded vs to offer with the floure in his Temple, but the diuinity which is ioined with the humanity in Chriſt? Vntill the gate of the Temple the floure was carried by it ſelfe, and the incenſe by itſelfe, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to the gate of the Temple, the one was incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with the other: which myſtery was moſt notably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed in the comming of Chriſt, becauſe that ſo farre aſunder was mankind which was here vpon earth, from the diuinity which was in heauen, but the ſon of God comming into the world, immediately God with man, and man with
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:3666:241"/>God became one. What is the oile with the which God commanded the floure and incenſe to be tempered, but that which in the bleſſed Trinitie wee call the holy-ghoſt? The coniunction &amp; bond of loue betwixt the Father and the ſon, and hee who did incorporate the floure with the incenſe, was no other but the holy-ghoſt, for ſo ſaid the propheſie, <hi>Vnxit te deus, deus tuus eleo letetia,</hi> and ſo ſaid the Angell vnto the virgine when he ſaid, <hi>Spiritus ſanctus ſuperueniet in te.</hi> That which the Prophet called oile, the Angell afterward did cal the holy-ghoſt: inſomuch that the cake which God deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of floure, oile, and incenſe, was nothing elſe but the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of him which was made by the father, and by the ſon, and by the holy-ghoſt. A cake ſo well ſeaſoned, a ſacrifice ſo highly well made, which of the ſaints would not offer, and which of the Angels would not adore? The ſacrifice which God did demand in times paſt, was not that which the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue did offer, but that which the catholike church doth now offer, for they did offer him dow wet in vineger, and fou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie oile, and moſt ſharpe incenſe, but the ſacrifice which wee doe now offer him is the humanity and diuinity of Chriſt, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited and put together by the handes of the holy-ghoſt. It is no reaſon that the Chriſtian and deuour reader ſhould be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant why God commanded but a part of the floure to bee offered, but all the incenſe. To put a meaſure in the floure was to ſay, that the humanity of it ſelfe was limitted and had an end, and to put no meaſure in the frankincenſe was to ſay, that in the diuinity there is neither beginning nor end, which is moſt true, becauſe the workes which the ſonne of God did were limmitted and circumſcribed in that, that he was man, but being kneaded with the oile of the holy-ghoſt, he made them infinite in value and weight. To come then to our firſt purpoſe, the text ſayth, <hi>si oblatio tua fuerit de ſartagine ſimile conſperſa oleo, &amp; abſque fermento, diuides eam minutatim, &amp; fundas ſuper cam oleum,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, The fritter which thou ſhalt offer vnto me, ſhall bee made of the floure of the meale, without leauen, kned with very good oile, and then
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:3666:242"/>being well pricked, thou ſhalt ſprinckle it ouer with new oile. If there ſhould bee no myſtery hidden vnder this Iudaicall ſacrifice, wee might haue occaſion to thinke that our Lord were a glutton, and giuen to variety of meats, ſeeing that in the beginning of this chapter he asked of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fritters or cake dreſſed with good oile, and now againe a cake made of the floure of wheat, and that without leauen, ſmall broken, and fried in a frying pan in very whote oile. Of this high and new ſacrifice, what is the floure but the humanity which ſuffered, what the oile but the loue with the vvhich hee died, and what the frying pan but the croſſe where hee died? To ſay that God the Father did aske for a cake made in a frying pan, and to ſay that the croſſe of his ſonne was the frying pan, and that the fine floure of his precious fleſh was fried in that fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingpan, and that the oile with the which it was fried was the loue with the which he redeemed vs, is no vnreuerent ſpeech to vſe; neither is there any errorin affirming it, ſeeing wee he certain that there is no word writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in holy Scripture which is not full of high myſtery. The property of the fryingpan is, being put vpon the fire the fire dooth not waſt him nor melt him as hee doth many other thinges, and beſide: hee maketh thoſe meats which are cold, hard, and not to be eaten; whote, ſoft, and very ſauourous. What was the death and paſsion of our redeemer Ieſus Chriſt, but a frying pan put to the fire? The ſacred humanity of Chriſt being put in the fryingpan of the croſſe, notwithſtanding all the torments which they gaue him, and all the iniuries and reproches which they ſpake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him they neuer diminiſhed any part of his vertue, for although for the ſpace of three daies his ſoule was ſeperated from his body, yet they deuide not his Diety from his ſoule, nor from his body. <hi>Iſichius</hi> vpon <hi>Leuiticus</hi> ſayth, Before that the ſonne of God was fried in the frying pan of the croſſe, his fleſh was ſo raw that it could not bee eaten, but after that the fire of his paſsion did ſeaſon it vs and frie it, there is nothing in heauen more ſauerous, nor nothing on the earth more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable. <hi>Cyrillus</hi> in another ſence ſaith, There were four things
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:3666:242"/>in this ſacrifice, fire, the pan, oile, and flour: Theſe four things were found in the paſsion of Chriſt, that is, the fire which the Iewes kindled to the end hee ſhould dieithe frying pan, vvas the croſſe which they ſought out where hee ſhould die: and the oile, the loue and charity with the vvhich hee died there for to redeeme the world: and the floure, his moſt ſacred fleſh vvhich there was fried. O glorious ſacrifice, O eternall meat, that thou art O ſonne of the liuing God, ſeeing that fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and whote, and ſeaſoned, thou diddeſt giue thy ſelfe in the frieng pan of the croſſe, to the end that all men might eat thee, and none excuſed from ſeruing thee. When the ſonne of God ſaid, <hi>Niſi manducaueritis carnem filij hominis,</hi> his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples being ſcandalized, <hi>Abierunt retrorſum &amp; dixerunt, durus est hic ſermo.</hi> But after that, that moſt ſacred fleſh was ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned &amp; fried in the frying pan of the croſſe, it was ſoft &amp; ſweer to taſt of, ſauerous to eat, and profitable to be taken. <hi>Sume tibi ſartaginem ferream, &amp; ponas eam murum ferreum, inter te &amp; eiuitatem,</hi> ſaid God by the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> chap. 4, as if hee ſhould ſay, Goe thy way out of the city, and thou ſhalt put a frieng pan of iron betweene thee and the city, becauſe thou maieſt neither ſee her, nor ſhee hurt thee. Who euer ſaw or heard the like, that the Lord ſhould command the Prophet to fight with a frying pan, and defend himſelfe behind the ſame? Tell me O <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> what hurt couldeſt thou do with a frying pan, ſeeing it hath no point, or how couldeſt thou defend thy ſelfe vnder it, conſidering that it will ſcarſe couer thy head? If thou wilt goe to fight take a launce with thee, and if thou wilt go to defend thy ſelfe from thy enemies take thy Target, becauſe the frying pan is fitter for the kitche<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the warre, and better to dreſſe meat with than to fight. O glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious croſſe, O holy frying pan, where the fleſh of my God was fried, where his bloud was ſhed, where his charitie vvas enflamed, where our fault was melted, and where his life was ended. The frying pan of the Synagogue was neither good for warres nor profitable for peace: But thou holy croſſe and happy frying pan waſt hee, with the which the diuell was
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:3666:243"/>ouercome, God pacified, the world redeemed, and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen opened. What thing can I put betwixt thee and mee O good Ieſus, but this precious croſſe &amp; frying pan where thou diddeſt end thy life, that my ſin might not come vnto thee, nor thy puniſhment paſſe to me. Doe thou not think my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, doe thou not think, that God commanded the Prophet to put betweene him and the city a frying pan, for any good that it would doe him, but for that which the frying pan ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified: for thereby was ſignified the croſſe and the crucified, which ſhould be a mediator betweene God and the world. O ſweet Ieſus, O my ſoules delight, where but in the frying pan of thy dolors and griefes, and where but in the oile of thy charity and loue, diddeſt thou end conſume and fry my enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious ſinnes? Where but in the frying pan of the croſſe, where thou ſaiedſt, <hi>Conſummatum eſt,</hi> giuing vs to vnderſtand by that laſt ſpeech, that there thou haddeſt ended and made a full account of our ſinne and thy anger, of our perdition and thy paſsion, of our ignorance and thy life?</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">D</seg>Igito ſuo vnxit Moyſes altare ſepties oleo vnctionis,</hi> this is written in the 40 chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Exodus,</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, In the ſame day that <hi>Moyſes</hi> did inſtitute his brother <hi>Aaron</hi> biſhop, and ordained alſo his children Prieſts, hee did annoint the great altar ſeuen times, and that with one finger, and did conſecrate it with oile. <hi>Cyrillus</hi> vpon this place ſayth, That although all the holy Scripture be full of myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:3666:243"/>yet there is greateſt attention to bee giuen when it ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the altar, or of a Prieſt, becauſe that, that myſtery cannot be handeled, and not talk of the myſteries of Chriſt. If we doe looke into the words of the text, we ſhall find that that which is annointed is the altar, that with the which it is ointed is holy oile, and the manner how is with one finger on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that ſeuen times; and that which was further ointed were all the ornaments of the altar. Theſe were the qualities of the altar, neere vnto it were the holy breads, before it bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned lampes, on the ſide of it they did put the candleſtickes, on the top of it the offered ſacrifices, at the foot of it they ſhed the bloud, behind it were the people, ouer againſt it was the vaile, vpon it was the Cherubin, about it were the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines. This altar was made of wood which would not rot, there could come none to it but the Prieſts, they could not goe vp to it by ſteps nor ſtaires, night and day lampes burned there, &amp; other fire which ſhould not be put out. Although the altar of the Synagogue had many priuiledges, and great free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, yet it had a counterpeiſe with it, which was, that vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it they ſlew all the beaſts which they did offer vnto God, &amp; therefore it was ſometimes ſo bloudy &amp; ſo loaden with flies, that it ſeemed rather a bord in the butchery to cut fleſh on, then an altar of the church. Who is the true altar, &amp; the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly altar, and the cleane altar, but only the ſonne of the liuing God? <hi>Origen</hi> ſayth, In the Temple of the Synagogue the altar was one thing, and the Prieſt another, &amp; another thing that which they offered; but in the altar of the church, the altar where they offer, and the Prieſt which doth offer, and the ſacrifice which is offered, and he vnto whom it is offered is one and the ſame thing. <hi>Leo</hi> in a Sermon of our Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſayth, In this high ſupper and in this holy altar, the ſonne of God is the ultar, and the meat, and he who inuiteth, and he who is inuited, he who eateth, and is eaten, hee who annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, and is annointed, he who offereth and is offered. What preheminences had the altar of the old Synagogue, which are not greater in the Catholicke church? Their altar was of
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:3666:244"/>the wood of the Mount Lybanus, &amp; ours of the moſt ſacred humanity of Chriſt; theirs was of wood which would not corrupt, and ours of fleſh which cannot ſinne; theirs was made bloody with other bloud than their owne, and ours is waſhed with his own bloud; vpon theirs they did kil beaſts, vpon ours they forgiue vs our offences; to theirs there could none go vp but the Prieſts of the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, but vnto ours al the ſinners of the world may come vnto; in theirs there burned a fire of light which muſt euery houre be kindled and put together, but in ours there burneth the fire of his loue and charity which can neuer be extinguiſhed. O holy altar, O glorious altar of the croſſe, in which there is offered not dead beaſts, but mens ſins, not to proue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but to pardon them, where our weake ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are offered, not becauſe thou wouldeſt praiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> O Lord, but becauſe thou wouldeſt accept them, and where alſo the merits of thy holy ſonne are offered, not for his own ſake who was without ſin, but for ours who can doe nothing but ſinne. The altar of the Synagogue had no ſtep nor ſtaire, becauſe the common ſort did beleeue nothing in God but his eſſence, but to the altar of our catholick church, which is a congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the faithful, they go vp by three ſteps, becauſe we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in one eſſence &amp; three perſons. The text alſo ſaith, that the altar of the ſynagogue was annointed with one finger on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: who ſhal we ſay that this finger is but the ſelfeſame holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghoſt? <hi>Hilarius de Trinitate</hi> ſaith, In al the Trinity there is but one arm, &amp; that is the Father, of whom the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Et brachiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortauit eum,</hi> neither is there any more but one hand which is the ſon, of whom alſo the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Filius meuses tuego hodie genui te,</hi> nor there is in all the Trinity but one finger of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſcripture ſaith, <hi>Digitus dei hic eſt.</hi> In the vnctions &amp; creations of vs there are many fingers occupied, that is, my great grandfather begat my grandfather, and my grandfather my father, &amp; my father begat me, &amp; I begat my ſon, and my ſonne begat my nephew: but in the generation of Chriſt there was applied one only finger, which was the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the holy-ghoſt. <hi>Auguſt</hi> in a ſermon ſayth, Seeing that
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:3666:244"/>he which doth beget is one, and hee who is begotten is one, and ſhe who doth bring forth is one, and he for whom hee is borne is one, which is the world; why ſhould there haue been more then one finger, which was the Holy-ghoſt? The text ſayth further, that the altar was not annointed once only, but ſeuen times a row. What is meant that Chriſt was annointed ſeuen times a row, but only that all the ſeuen gifts of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-ghoſt were beſtowed vpon him? It is to bee noted, that in all the ſacrifices which they made of kine, ſheepe, and goats, and pigeons, the altar was alwaies annointed with bloud, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing when they ordained <hi>Aaron</hi> a prieſt, at what time they did annoint it with oile alone, the which was not done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a myſtery. The reaſon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is this, that becauſe al their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were done to take away the Iews ſins, the which were to bee taken away with ſhedding of bloud, <hi>Quia ſine ſanguinis effuſione non fit remiſsio,</hi> ſayth the Apoſtle, there was no need of effuſion of bloud in the ſacrifice which did only repreſent Chriſt, becauſe in him there was no ſinne at all. Why ſhould they haue annointed with bloud the altar of the humanity of Chriſt, conſidering that not onely there was no ſin in him, but in him all the ſins of the world were to be taken away? If the curious Reader would deeply vnderſtand this high figure let him turn <hi>Moyſes</hi> name into the Father, and <hi>Aarons</hi> name into Chriſt, and the altar into humanity, and the name of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing into gift, and bloud into the water of baptiſm, &amp; the finger into the holy-ghoſt, and then hee ſhall truly find, how well the truth doth anſwere vnto the figure, and the letter to the ſpirit. The text ſayth further in the ſame chapter. <hi>Vnxit altare cum omniſuppellectili,</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, After that <hi>Moyſes</hi> had made an end of annointing the altar with holy oile, hee did alſo annoint all things that did belong to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, that is, ewars, baſins, candleſtickes, towels, hookes, chafin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhes. Let no man thinke it to bee a ieſt, that God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to annoint with holy oile, not only the altar, but alſo all things which did appettaine to the altar, becauſe that by this is diſcouered one of the greateſt priuiledges that Chriſt had,
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:3666:245"/>which no man did euer but hee enioy in the world. What ſhould it meane that at the altar of the Synagogue there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained nothing which was not annointed with oile, but that there was nothing in the humanity of the word which was not fully repleniſhed with the holy-ghoſt? Why is Chriſt called <hi>Sanctus ſanctoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> but becauſe his holy vnction was more holy tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that of all the other ſaints? When the church doth waſh her creatures in baptiſm, ſhee doth with water waſh, and as it were only there annoint ſoules which were defiled with ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſin, the which ſoules are made ſo clean &amp; pure with that vnction, that if they ſhould depart preſently out of this life, they ſhould imediately by Gods fauor go to glory. O vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py that we be, for although they waſh &amp; annoint our ſoule in baptiſm, yet there remaineth our memory to be annointed, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that wee forget God; there remaineth our vnderſtanding to be annointed, ſeeing we think of other things tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God; there remaineth our will to be annointed, ſeeing that wee put our loue on other things beſides God; &amp; alſo our hart remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to be annointed, ſeeing we giue it to another tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to god. What ſhall we ſay of our poore body, ſeeing there is no part or me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of it which is annointed? ſeeing my eies can ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but vanity, my ears hear nothing but lightnes, my toung nothing but lie, my me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit ſin, &amp; my hands theft? what ſhal I ſay of ſuch a body, is he not rather rotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> annointed? whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid with weeping tears, alas &amp; woe be vnto me vnhappy &amp; vnfortunate man, who wil deliuer me fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſeruitude of this body? would he haue ſpoken ſuch pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful words if the powers of his body had been annointed with holy oile of loue &amp; charity? the church like a pittiful mother doth annoint vs with the wholſome water of baptiſme when we be born, &amp; afterward ſhe doth waſh and annoint vs vvith loue &amp; charity whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe doth giue vs grace to loue god &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue our neighbors: the firſt vnctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is to help vs that we do not ſin, &amp; the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to make vs clean of al that which we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſinned. O what ſmall need Chriſt hath to bee ſo many times annointed, nor by the church helped; for from the firſt inſtant of his incarnation was annointed, not only the altar of
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:3666:245"/>his moſt holy humanity, to enioy preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly the diuine eſſence, but alſo all the members of his holy body were annointed, becauſe they might neuer ſinne, nor neuer be ſeperated from God. The figure of annointing the altar with all the furniture was ſpoke of none but of Chriſt, nor fulfilled in none but in Chriſt alone, becauſe it doth eaſily appeare, that as the holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghoſt left no part in his ſoule nor body, which he did not ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie and make holy, ſo there was no power in his ſoule nor body, which to our benefite hee did not imploy. Wee may better ſay of Chriſt than of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> hee dooth annoint the altar, <hi>Cum omni ſuppellectile,</hi> ſeeing that with his feet hee viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the altars of the Temples, with his hands cured the ſick, with his tongue preached to the people, and with his heart forgaue ſinners.</p>

With a high ſtile and lofty wordes the Apoſtle doth extoll the greatneſſe and power of God in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him Father, and Father of mercies; and God, and the God of conſolations: and aboue all that, he keepeth them
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:3666:246"/>not for himſelf only, but doth ſuccour vs with them in all our tribulations. O how happy is the Apoſtle who vttereth theſe words, and how bleſſed wee Chriſtians for whom hee ſpake them, and how bleſſed is Chriſt, by whoſe merits they were ſpoken? What grauer ſentences, or ſweeter words could bee ſpoken, ſeeing that by them he maketh himſelfe, of God, our Father; of a iudge, our aduocate; of a Lord, our brother; of a reuenger, mercifull; of him which was cruell, gentle &amp; meek; of him which could not be ſpoken with, moſt affable; and of one which was inuiſible, treatable. Thou maiſt haue pitty on me, and I haue pitty on thee, and I can comfort thee, &amp; thou canſt comfort me, but to haue pitty on all, who can doe it but only the father of mercies? and comfort all men, who is able to doe it but only the father of all conſolations? If I be ſicke one may cure me, if I be naked another can cloth me, if I be ſad a freind can ſomewhat comfort mee, but tell mee I pray thee, who is able to helpe mee in all tribulation and diſtreſſe, but only our Lord who doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort vs in all our tribulations? Who ſayth by the Pſalme, <hi>Cum ipſo ſum in tribulatione,</hi> &amp; of whom ſpeaketh the Apoſtle, <hi>Quod conſolatur nos in omni tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulatione:</hi> of who was he euer called whom he did not helpe? The father of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt is he, who in calling vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, doth open; in ſpeaking to him, doth anſwer; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing demanded any iuſt thing, doth graunt it. By peeces &amp; by patches, and by crownes men can giue vs of their pleaſures, and the world his delights: onely hee who is the God of all comfort can comfort vs in our diſtreſſes, and ſuccour vs in our neceſsities. It is much to be noted, that the Apoſtle doth not ſay the God of conſolation, but the Lord of all conſolation: whereof wee may inferre, that all comfort which dooth not come of him is diſſolute or fained, or imperfect. Wee ſhould haue great pitty on thoſe men which ſay, Let vs go ſport our ſelues at the water, let vs goe walke in a garden, who ſeeme rather to play the Idolaters then to recreate themſelues, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they put all their felicity and caſe in ſeeing a greene med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow in the running of the riuer, in flouriſhing trees, and to ſit
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:3666:247"/>in a banketting houſe. <hi>Seneca</hi> in an Epiſtle ſayth, Let no man thinke that conſolation dooth conſiſt in that which wee ſee with our eies, or heare with our eares, or touch with our hands, or ſmel with our noſe, but only in that which the heart deſireth: for no man can bee at reſt, if his heart haue not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. With variety of meats the taſt is recreated, the ſight reioiceth in faire ſights, the hearing is delighted with ſweet muſick, the ſmell is pleaſed with aromaticall perfumes, and the feeling ioieth in ſoft thinges; but what ſhall the poole heart doe, which neither taketh taſt in meats, nor pleaſure in muſicke, nor delight in that which it ſeeth, nor contentment in that which it ſmelleth? what other thing ſaith the church when ſhe ſayth, <hi>Surſum corde,</hi> but that we ſhould lift vp our hearts vnto God, ſeeing that there is no perfect conſolation for them below in the world. Al wicked men would bid God much good doe it him with his glory, if they could find any perfect caſe vpon earth for their hearts, but becauſe they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not find it, bee he neuer ſo bad hee ſighteth to goe to heauen. We ſay all this, becauſe the Apoſtle ſaying, that hee is the God of all conſolation, how can any man haue any conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this life, vnleſſe hee giue it him who is the God of all conſolation? How great ſoeuer a lord <hi>Hector</hi> was in Troy, &amp; how great ſoeuer <hi>Alexander</hi> was in Aſia, and how mighty ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer <hi>Caeſar</hi> was in Rome; notwithſtanding Chriſt was greater in his church: becauſe all thoſe Princes were ſuch ouer their cities only, but the ſonne of God is the God of all conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. What greater pleaſure then to giue pleaſure to whom thou loueſt, what greater contentment then to giue content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to whome thou likeſt? Our Lord kept this treaſure for himſelfe alone, and reſerued this ſegniory for himſelf, that is, <hi>Quod ſit deus totius conſolationis,</hi> and therevpon it is, that if he will not ſhew that which hee can doe, and impart among vs that which he hath, no iuſt ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould liue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tedly, nor any Angell happily. If as one is lord of many poſſeſsions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances, he were alſo of many pleaſures and conſolations, what would wee not giue for them, what would wee not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:3666:247"/>to attaine vnto them, and vnto what would we not put our ſelues to take them? All mortal men go after their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and hunt for delight, but alaſſe they ſeeke them in the houſe of the God of trauels which is the world, and forſake the Lord of conſolations which is God, and therefore they goe aſtray in that which they ſeeke, and goe diſcomforted in that which they deſire. <hi>Barnard</hi> in a ſermon ſayth, O what a great comfort it is to the good, that they haue him for their God and Lord who is the God and Lord of all conſolations: for it is not to be beleeued, that being the God of al comforts, that he doth not impart ſome of them vnto his; and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, ſeeing that hee doth not diſcomfort thoſe which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him, who will not beleeue but hee will comfort thoſe which ſerue him? When the Apoſtle ſayth that our God is the God of all conſolations, and not onely that, but alſo the father of mercies, we haue great cauſe to loue him, and to be thankfull vnto him, ſeeing that not long before hee called himſelfe the God of reuenge, as now he dooth call himſelfe the Father of mercies. S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſayth, What greater news could we hear, or what could he giue vs for a greater reward, then for our Lord to giue himſelfe vnto vs for our father, his ſonne for our brother, the holy-ghoſt for our maiſter, his church for our mother, the Sacraments for a medicine, his death for a pardon, &amp; his bloud for our redemption? <hi>Iſichius</hi> vpon Leuiticus ſayth, Marke the depth of the Scripture, and thou ſhalt ſee that when he ſpeaketh of mercies, it doth not call God, <hi>Deus miſericordiarum,</hi> The God of mercy, but <hi>Pater miſericordiarum,</hi> the Father of mercies; and when it talketh of iuſtice, it doth not call him <hi>Pater vltionum,</hi> but <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us vltionum,</hi> The God of reuenge, becauſe it is the office of God to puniſh, and the duty of the father to pardon. The Prophets did oft vſe this word <hi>Deus,</hi> God, and helped them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues little with this word <hi>Pater,</hi> Father; and Chriſt contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, did oft benefite himſelfe with this word <hi>Pater,</hi> Father, and ſildome with this name <hi>Deus,</hi> God: giuing vs thereby to vnderſtand, that the time of iuſtice was now ended, and that
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:3666:248"/>the time of mercy was come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſidorus De ſummo bono,</hi> ſayth, O eternall good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and depth of all vviſedome, vvhy ſhould I diſtruſt in thy great clemency, being that thou art my Father, and Father of all mercy? Let the Pagans diſtruſt in thee who beleeue thee not, let the vvicked diſtruſt in thee vvho ſerue thee not, for I vvill hope in thee vvith thoſe vvhich ſerue thee and loue thee: For although I cannot wholly ſerue thee, I labour as much as I can not to offend thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſelmus</hi> vpon the Apoſtle ſayth, After I heard thee ſay, O my good Ieſus, <hi>Pater ignoſce illis;</hi> and the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>Pater miſericordiarum,</hi> Although my naughty life make mee afraid, yet thy great mercy commeth immediately to my mind, for the ſame day that thou diddeſt make thy ſelfe man, thou did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt change thy name, from the God of Reuenge, into the Father of Mercies. O glorious and happy chaunge, that is, the changing the name of God into the name of Father, and the name of a Reuenger in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the name of a Defender, the name of Iuſtice into the name of Mercy, the name of a Creator into the name of a Redeemer, all which thou diddeſt chaunge vvhen thou waſt made man, and diddeſt ſuffer on the croſſe for mee.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> vpon the Apoſtles vvordes ſayth, Tell mee O good Ieſus, tell mee O great Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, after thou haddeſt chaunged the name of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us vltionum</hi> into the name of <hi>Pater miſericordiarum,</hi> what diddeſt thou ſee ſo hard that thou diddeſt not bring to paſſe, or vvhat ſinne diddeſt thou ſee ſo enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that thou diddeſt not pardon? In calling thy ſelfe the Father of mercies thou diddeſt forgiue <hi>Matthew</hi> his exchanges, <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> her vanities, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritane
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:3666:248"/>her Adulteries, the good theefe his theft, and the fiſher-man <hi>Peter</hi> his denying of thee, the Apoſtles forſaking of thee, and thy enemies putting thee to death. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſayth, Seeing that the time of <hi>Deus vltionum</hi> is paſt, and that the time of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter miſericordiarum</hi> is come, haue mercy on mee, O great God of Iſrael, haue mercy on mee: and when ſhall this bee, but vvhen thou vvilt giue me ſtrength to ſerue and praiſe thee, and endue mee vvith grace to ſaue mee? O Father of mercies, O the God of all conſolation, vvhen ſhall my ſoule heare for her ſelfe, <hi>Pater ignoſce illi,</hi> as the vvicked Synagogue did heare thee ſay, Father forgiue them? What doth it auaile mee, that thou haſt pardoned thoſe vvhich did then put thee to death, if thou doe not alſo now forgiue vs vvhich moſt vvickedly offend thee? Children for children, ſinners for ſinners, there is as great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that thou ſhouldeſt pardon thoſe of thy holy church as thoſe of the Synagogue, for if they vvere children of the God of reuenge vvho did put thee to death then, they are alſo children of the Father of mercies, who do offend thee now.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his Confeſsions ſayth: O Father of mercies and God of all comfort, if it bee true that I vvas vvith thoſe vvhich tooke thy life from thee vpon the croſſe, vvhy ſhouldeſt thou not as well forgiue mee my fault, as thou diddeſt then theirs?</p>
               <p>Vnto thee O eternall Father, I ſay <hi>Mea culpa,</hi> and vnto thee O holy ſonne I confeſſe my offence, in that, that if I vvas not vvith <hi>Iudas</hi> vvhen hee ſold thee, yet I vvas vvith the vvicked and vngratefull Iewes vvhen they did crucifie thee: for if they did faſten thee on the croſſe vvith nailes, I did there crucifie thee vvith my ſinnes. <hi>Anſelmus</hi> in his Meditations ſayth, O good Ieſus, O the bliſſe of my ſoule, vvho

That which <hi>Dauid</hi> commanded his ſonne <hi>Salomon</hi> to doe, was not commanded to one who was deaffe, for if hee did command him to kill two, hee did kill three or foure, that is, the infant <hi>Abdonias,</hi> the captaine <hi>Ioab, Simei,</hi> and the Prieſt <hi>Abiathar.</hi> In al his kingdome <hi>Dauid</hi> had no captaine which had done him ſo great ſeruice, nor no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant which had loued him better than old <hi>Ioab,</hi> yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, he had more reſpect to reuenge the iniuries done to others, than vnto their ſeruices paſt. If <hi>Dauid</hi> had not been welbeloued, and by Scripture commended, his Teſtament ſhould much haue ſcandalized vs, ſeeing that at the time of his death when men forbid iniuries, hee commandeth by his Teſtament to take away mens liues. It is to be beleeued, that he being ſo acceptable to God as he was, that he had conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with God, for otherwiſe being in ſo narrow a ſtraight as he was in, it was more than time for him to prepare himſelfe to confeſſe his ſins, than to command the death of his enemies. O how vnlike <hi>Dauids</hi> Teſtament is vnto Chriſts, for <hi>Dauid</hi> commaunded in his to reuenge other mens deaths, but Ieſus Chriſt our Redeemer commanded his owne proper death to be pardoned. How happy we be which be the inheritours of Chriſt, and how vnhappy they be which bee the ſucceſſours of <hi>Dauid,</hi> which is eaſily ſeene by their Teſtaments, for <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> ſoule goeth out of his body, ſaying, <hi>Filine ignoſcas illis,</hi> and Chriſt yeeldeth his laſt breath, ſaying, <hi>Pater ignoſce illis,</hi> What ſimilitude is in this, when the one commaundeth to ſlay <hi>Ioab,</hi> who neuer once touched ſo much as his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the ſonne of God willeth to forgiue thoſe which

How would <hi>Dauid</hi> forgiue his owne death, ſeeing he commandeth to reuenge another mans? wilt thou ſee the difference betwixt the charity of the one, and the goodneſſe of the other? Thou maieſt ſee it in that, that king <hi>Dauid</hi> would not pardon <hi>Ioab</hi> and <hi>Simei,</hi> whoſe ſinnes were ſo old that they were forgotten: and meeke Ieſus did pardon the Iewes, whoſe wickednes was new and freſh. How wouldeſt thou haue the wounds of him vvho pardoneth, more freſher, and the wickedneſſe of thoſe which are pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned more newer, but to haue them at the ſame time crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng as he is pardoning. <hi>Aymon</hi> ſayth, Much good may <hi>Dauids</hi> Teſtament doe him, which hee made being annointed, for I will hold with that which Chriſt made when he was crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the one ſeeketh out thoſe which are culpable to kill, and the other ſeeketh out faults to pardon. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> vpon our Lords wordes ſaith, O how much better it is to fall into the hands of God then into the hands of men, which is eaſily ſeene in the death of king <hi>Dauid,</hi> and in the death of the ſonne of God, where the one commandeth to ſlay his owne ſeruants, and the other willeth pardon to his cruel ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. <hi>Hugo de ſancte victore</hi> ſayth, I do not enuy king <hi>Salomon</hi> for the kingdome which king <hi>Dauid</hi> his father left him, nor for his will which he comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded him to accompliſh, becauſe he left him the heire of his kingdome with ſuch a condition, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſhould giue the laſt gaſpe, the other ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently begin to murder and kill. In the ſame day and in the ſame houre that good king <hi>Dauid</hi> died, as the captaine <hi>Ioab</hi> was in the Temple a praying, kind <hi>Salomon</hi> ſent immediately to ſley him, inſomuch that before they could put <hi>Dauid</hi> in his graue, they tooke away poor <hi>Ioabs</hi> life. O my good Ieſus, the conditions of thy Teſtament be not like vnto theſe, ſeeing that in the laſt farwell on the altar of the croſſe, thou diddeſt not command thy ſucceſſors to reuenge, but to forgiue, nor to take away mens liues, but to pardon iniuries, ſo that as the Synagogue was a houſe of buying and ſelling, ſo thou madeſt thy church a houſe of pardon. Chriſt himſelfe did whip thoſe
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:3666:250"/>who bought and ſold in the Temple, and the ſelfeſame ſon of God did pardon thoſe whom he found in his houſe of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: whereof wee may inferre, that he is no inhabitant of his houſe, who dareth reuenge an iniury. Chriſt did ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be the ſonne of <hi>Dauid,</hi> in being meeke as hee was, but he ſhewed it not in being vindicatiue as he was, for when he died vpon the croſſe, he did not leaue in al the world any one ſinne to forgiue, nor any iniury for his heires to reuenge. If as <hi>Dauid</hi> did command to reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge the miſdemeanour which his ſeruants did him, Chriſt ſhould haue commanded to reuenge the ſinnes which the Iewes committed againſt him, it had not been poſsible to haue been done, becauſe the ſinners had too many ſinnes, and the tormentors wanted torments.</p>

And becauſe thou maieſt the better eſteeme of the price of this bloud, know thou that it crieth before the eternal father better than the bloud of <hi>Abel,</hi> becauſe that cried Iuſtice, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and the bloud of the ſonne of God crieth Mercy, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. S. <hi>Ierome</hi> ſayth, The Apoſtle dooth highly ſet forth the bloud of Chriſt, whoſe ſoueraine price and high merit hee would not compare with the other blouds of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but with the bloud of the firſt iuſt man that euer was in
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:3666:251"/>the world, the bloud of the holieſt ſaint that is in heauen. <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigen</hi> ſaith, The Apoſtle ſhould haue done Chriſt great iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if hee ſhould haue compared his bloud with the bloud of calues and goats of the old Teſtament, becauſe the bloud of thoſe beaſtes did ſerue to no other purpoſe but to defile the ſtaires, and to take away their liues: but the bloud of the ſon of God dooth waſh and make cleane offences, and ſaue our ſouls. The firſt bloud with the which God was offended, was the bloud of <hi>Abel;</hi> and the firſt bloud with which God was pleaſed, was the bloud of Chriſt; and that which is moſt to be wondered at is, that the bloud of <hi>Abel</hi> did benefite but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alone, but the bloud of Chriſt did profite all the world. S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſayth, What bloud can be compared vnto the bloud of Chriſt? for the bloud of <hi>Abel</hi> did ſtirre vp, and not appeaſe, ſeeing that thereby hee loſt his life, and his brother his ſoule: The bloud which thou didſt ſhed for mee O ſweet Ieſus, did not ſtirre vp, but appeaſe, becauſe it did pacifie the fathers anger, tooke away thy owne life, and redeemed my ſoule. <hi>Anſelmus</hi> ſayth, The bloud of <hi>Abel</hi> is bloud, and the bloud of Chriſt is bloud, the one the bloud of a iuſt man, and ſo likewiſe the other; that was ſhed by enuy, and this ſhed through enuy: But the difference was, that the bloud of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> cried from the earth, and the bloud of the ſonne of God praied from the croſſe. Weigh well this ſpeech, <hi>Clamabat ad me de terra,</hi> and alſo that, <hi>Melius loquentem quam Abel,</hi> and thereby thou ſhalt perceiue how the bloud of <hi>Abel</hi> doth crie for vengeance vpon his brother <hi>Cain,</hi> and the bloud of the ſonne of God doth pray for mercy for all the world. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der well of this word <hi>Melius loquentem,</hi> that is, that the bloud of Chriſt ſhould haue been but of ſmall profit, if hee ſhould haue died for none but for thoſe of that time. The Apoſtle doth not ſay, that the bloud of Chriſt did then ſpeake onely, but that it doth ſpeake now, and will ſpeake vntill the worlds end, and therevpon it is, that we do repreſent this bloud eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, and offer it in our praiers: for otherwiſe, as there is no day in which wee doe not commit ſome ſinne againſt him, ſo
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:3666:251"/>there ſhould no day paſſe in which wee ſhould not ſuffer ſome puniſhment. Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> ſayth, His offence is very great which committeth a fault, if hee doe not immediately helpe himſelfe with the bloud of Chriſt, for if it bee froſen for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans and Heretikes, yet it is freſh and whot for Chriſtians and ſinners. It is alſo to bee marked, that the Apoſtle ſayth not <hi>Acceſsistit ad ſanguinis effuſionem,</hi> but <hi>ad ſanguinis aſperſionem,</hi> which ſpeech he vſed not for the wicked Synagogue, but for the holy mother church, becauſe the Synagogue was in the time of ſhedding of bloud, but the holy church came to the ſprinckling &amp; gathering of it together. O how happy we Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians be, and how vnhappy the Iewes were, ſeeing that they came <hi>Ad ſanguinis effuſionem,</hi> to the ſhedding of bloud, and we Chriſtians <hi>Ad ſanguinis aſperſionem,</hi> ſo that they ſhed the bloud of the ſon of God &amp; did not gather it vp, &amp; we gather it and did not ſhed it. S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> vpon S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, By this ſpeech of <hi>Aſperſionem ſanguinis,</hi> the Apoſtle doth let vs vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that the bloud of <hi>Abel</hi> had no other force the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be ſhed vpon the earth, but with the bloud of the ſon of God all the catholicke church was as it were with Iſope ſprinckeled, ſo that all the bloud of the Synagogue was but ſhed &amp; caſt on the ground, but the bloud of Chriſt was ſhed, &amp; imparted amongſt vs. <hi>Cyrillus</hi> vpon Leuit. ſaith, The church was at the ſprinckling of bloud, but the ſynagogue at the effuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of bloud, ſeeing that of the bloud of the Synagogue there was no drop gathered, &amp; of the bloud of the church there was no drop loſt. S. <hi>Barnard</hi> ſaith, As for the bloud of <hi>Abel</hi> let it be loſt, but as for the bloud of the ſon of God, it is not lawful that any ſhould be loſt. And he goeth gathering it drop by drop, who by little &amp; litle doth imitate Chriſts life, he doth gather one drop who doth imitate him in one vertue, &amp; he doth imitate him in two drops who doth follow him in two, &amp; hee doth gather many drops who doth beſtow himſelfe in the getting of many ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, inſomuch that as on the croſſe he gaue it in recompence of wickedneſſe, ſo he doth now giue it in exchange of vertues.</p>

The louing wordes which Chriſt ſpeaketh vnto the ſoule, and the anxiety and griefe which the ſoule vttereth vnto Chriſt, who can better declare than the ſoule which is familiar with Chriſt? Such deepe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſuch pittifull wounds, ſuch true complaints, and griefes ſo lamentably vttered, as theſe are which are contained vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe words, how is it poſsible for my pen to write, or my heart to taſt of? How ſweet our Lord is to the ſoule which ſeeketh him, and how delightfull vnto the ſoule which cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vpon him, and how pleaſant vnto the ſoule which dooth keepe him, is ſo high a language, that none is able to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, but only that ſoule which dooth deſerue to taſt of the ſame. Firſt of all it is here to be noted, why Chriſt dooth call a holy ſoule once ſiſter, and another time ſpouſe: for if ſhe be a ſiſter ſhe cannot be a ſpouſe, and if ſhe be a ſpouſe ſhee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a ſiſter. The myſtery of this ſecret is, that ſhe is called ſpouſe becauſe of the faith which ſhee tooke of Chriſt, and
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:3666:252"/>ſhe is called ſiſter, becauſe of the fleſh which Chriſt tooke, in ſo much that Chriſt is our bridegroome in that, that hee is our Creator, and he is our brother in that, that hee is our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. Twiſe the bridegroome complaineth to haue beene wounded of his bride, ſaying, Thou haſt wounded my heart my ſiſter, thou haſt wounded my heart my ſpouſe: for in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of two loues hee hath compaſsion on her, and in reſpect of two loues he ſuffered for her, that is, for hauing made her to his likeneſſe and ſemblance, and for hauing redeemed her with his bloud. For Chriſt to ſay twiſe. Thou haſt wounded me, thou haſt wounded me; is to ſay, thou haſt been vnthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the fauour I did to create thee, and thou haſt been vngratefull for the benefite which I did thee in redeeming thee: inſomuch that to bee vnthankfull vnto Chriſt for theſe two benefites, is to wound Chriſts heart with two deepe wounds. S. <hi>Barnard</hi> vpon the Canticles ſaith, Note well that Chriſt doth not ſay [thou haſt broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my head] but [thou haſt pierced my heart] to let vs thereby vnderſtand, that all the offences which we commit againſt him, and alſo all the ſerui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which wee doe for him, doe reach vntill his heart, as hee doth loue vs with the heart. <hi>Anſelmus</hi> to this purpoſe ſayth, Our Lord doth ieſt with no man, nor will not bee ieſted at by any man, and therevpon he loueth vs with all his heart if we be in ſtate of grace, and hateth vs with his heart if we bee in his diſgrace. By reaſon whereof, there is no offence which we doe commit againſt his Maieſty, vvhich goeth not to his heart, nor there is no ſeruice which we do to him, but he doth keepe it in his heart. <hi>Origen</hi> ſayth, The cauſe why the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome doth complaine vpon the bride, and not the bride a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the bridegroome is, becauſe the ſoule hath no cauſe to complaine vpon God, and God hath ſcarſe no cauſe to bee pleaſed with the ſoule. The bridegroome complaineth that the bride woundeth him in the heart, becauſe that one heart cannot be hurt but of another heart, becauſe that that cannot be called a fault, but that which doth determinatly proceed from the will. Then thy heart doth pierce and wound Chriſts
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:3666:253"/>heart, when reaſon doth teach thee that thou ſhouldeſt not ſinne, and yet notwithſtanding thy will dooth determine to ſinne, whereof God dooth not ſo much hold himſelfe iniuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of that which thou doeſt, as of the heart and will with the which thou doeſt it. Thou doeſt ſo many times wound Chriſt as thou doeſt conſent vnto ſinne, and therefore hee ſayth that thou haſt wounded his heart, becauſe his iniuries and offences proceeded from thy heart. It is much to bee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that hee ſayth not, thou haſt killed my heart, but thou haſt wounded my heart: for ſeeing that we ſee ſome die only becauſe his heart is moued &amp; ſtirred, it ſhould be greater rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that they ſhould die hauing their heart wounded. If a griefe of the heart be hardly cured, how ſhall that heart bee healed which is wounded? If it be ſo, that all the wounds in the heart are mortall, and not to bee cured, why doth Chriſt ſay that his louer had wounded his heart, &amp; not confeſſe that he had killed him? By this is knowne the difference betwixt offending God and offending man, for a man dieth with eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wound becauſe he will neuer forgiue and pardon, but holy Ieſus doth not complaine that they kill him, but onely that they wound him. Giuing vs therby to vnderſtand, that at the ſame inſtant when a ſoule doth repent her of her offences, he doth hold himſelfe ſatisfied for that fault. What ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of vs, if Chriſt ſhould ſay that wee doe kill him as hee ſayth that we doe wound him? What other thing were it to take Chriſts life away, but to ſinne without hope of mercy? God ſpeaking with the Angell ſayth, <hi>Interfecisti cor meum,</hi> and ſpeaking with man ſayth onely, <hi>Vulneraſti cor meum,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſinne of the Angell had no remiſsion, but the ſinne of man obtaineth euery day pardon. O good Ieſus, O creator of my ſoule, how much are wee bound vnto thee in ſaying, that we doe wound thee, and not that wee doe kill thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that by this high ſpeech thou doeſt let vs vnderſtand, that the wounds which we giue thee in the heart, and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences which wee commit againſt thee, are as eaſily cured as they are eaſily amended. Let no man deſpaire, let no man be
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:3666:253"/>diſcomforted in thinking that he ſhall not bee pardoned, and that there is no remedy for his offences; ſeeing that the ſon of God doth confeſſe, that wee haue not wholly ſlaine him, but only wounded him: of which wounds hee then beginneth to be cured when wee begin to amend. O infinite goodneſſe, O great charity of thine, O my good Ieſus, tell mee I pray thee, what diddeſt thou ſee in my ſinfull ſoule, that thou ſhouldeſt truſt the weapons in her hands which ſhee may wound thee with, and alſo the medicines with the which ſhee may cure thee? what are the weapons with the which ſhe doth wound thee, but the faults which ſhee dooth commit againſt thee? And what is the medicine with the which ſhee dooth cure thee, but only the amendment of her owne life? Chriſt ſaith further, that the weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with the which the bride did wound him was one of her eies which ſhe had in her head, and with one of her haires which hanged at her throat, ſo that her eies ſerued her for arrowes, and her hair for bindings. <hi>Origen</hi> vpon this place ſayth, O how tender the heart is which is woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the only ſight of an eie, and what ſmall force and ſtrength he hath who is bound with a hair. The heart which is touched of our Lord, although he be ſtronger then <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and lighter then <hi>Aſael,</hi> yet in louing of God and taſting of Gods holy loue, it is eaſily taken, and ſuffereth himſelfe to be bound without reſiſtance. We haue two eies in our head to ſee with, and wee haue two eies in our ſoules to loue with, whereof the one is the eie of loue, and the other is the eie of feare, and when our Lord ſayth that wee looke vpon him with one eie, hee ſayth that ſometimes wee ſerue him with feare, and ſometimes with loue. Men of high per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection doe looke vpon him with the eie of loue, and men of leſſer perfection with the eie of feare, and the difference is, that with the ſight of the one there is no alteration at all, and with the ſight of the other ſhe is preſently delighted. What can there be in the world more ſweeter to the taſt, or wherin our ſoule may receiue greater recreation, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to fix all our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to behold and look vpon God, and ſerue him with all
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:3666:254" rendition="simple:additions"/>our heart. When do we look vpon him with one eie only, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for loue we ſerue him, and not for fear? What can Chriſt ſpeake more tenderly vnto our ſoule, or what more ſweeter words can his holy mouth vtter vnto the ſoule, than to ſay that ſhe had wounded him with one eie, and tied him faſt with one haire? O infinite loue of thine my Creator and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, tell me I pray thee if thou be ſo eaſily ſatisfied with a ſoule that doth but once behold thee, what wilt thou doe by her which doth behold thee euery day, and ſerue thee all her life time? S. <hi>Barnard</hi> ſayth, He doth bind God with one haire who thinketh on God and nothing elſe, and hee doth wound him with the ſight of one eie, who loueth him and no other, ſo that it lieth in our owne hands to ſerue Chriſt and attaine vnto his bliſſe and felicitie.</p>
